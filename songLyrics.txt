Don't feel bad and don't look back, I don't feel bad
Shame on you, you hate everything thats new

You catch on years later, you're not even slow
Can't stay have a good time, now I've gotta go
I can't stay you're in the way, so listen when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me I might, when I'm talking

Makes you think I would when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me I might when I won't!

I've got to get up ma, and get in my place
I've got to work out ma, and sort out my face
I've got all 'zines telling me what to eat
And I'm tired of being told what to wear on my feet
And I don't have the time to get all worked up about the year on the street
And it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
There goes another day, I've been here too long
Do I have to change into what it takes, yeah make it No.1
I feel out of flavour, I don't look like a picture
You think I'm a loser, but I can see through you
You're running around like you're running the country
I know that you think that you've got one on me
Ear to the ground like a boy about town
Can't get nothing to fit me!
And it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
There goes another day, I've been here too long
Do I have to change in to what it takes, yeah make it No.1
Got to call for an old friend who used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Sold his house, sold his car
Bought a ticket to the West coast
Now he gives him 'em a stand-up routine in L.A.
yeah but it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
Got to look out for an old friend who used to be real close
Said it couldn't go on the American way
Sold his house, sold his car
Bought a ticket to the West coast
Now he gives 'em a stand-up routine in L.A.
Do I have to change in to what it takes, yeah make it No.1

Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
I think I'm trouble, there's always a couple
Around me wherever I go
They're out there to bug me
I don't think it's funny
Everybody's laughing at me yeah
I wanna go out, but there's no one about
All my friends want a quiet one at home
They're that same age as me
And their husbands to be yeah
Everybody in the building
Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
I make a move here, and I make a move there
I've got millions of things on the go
I'll write me the best lines, they're too corny sometimes
Everybody's laughing at me
Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long

First stepped out of the aeroplane
I'd felt like I'd been here before
Took a ?? me down
Put a smile on my face
Felt like I could do more
How ace are buildings!
How big are the blocks
Reminds me of London, stuck in a graveyard
Six foot deep, bleaker street, no one lives out
People smile, never got the time
I look down I can not see the ground
A man who reads the news says there's no crime
There's no one around
There wasn't a sound
There's no one to arrest today
??
Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it
Don't ever what to go back
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96
-10, 1pm east village time
I laugh at your ?? you bought
Snow, snow, so we walk 70 blocks
On days like this nothing seems to far
Get in shot, I don't ask a lot
The weather was frozen, there wasn't a ??
Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it
Don't ever what to go back
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96
Maybe I could be here a long time
Much longer than I planned to stay
No telling when they'll get the airport open
No telling when i'll get way
Trying to tell us nothing's wrong
Trying to get the fire back on
Never lost a day of fun
Silence in the heightened mass of ??
How ace are buildings!
How big are the blocks
Reminds me of London, stuck in a gridlock


You're always fighting everyone
You were wroung when you were young
You love to think you're on the run
I had to laugh at all your jokes
Had to tremble 'cos you smoked
But you never ever get my vote, yeah!
You're the ones to run from, or so they say
I remember you back in the day
Did my best to keep out of the way
You kicked it up in school
Singing out of tune
While you're fighting everyone
I've been hanging in the sun
There's a million things I've done
You're the one who took the lead
Me least likely to succeed
Different now don't you agree
You're the ones to run from, or so they say
I remember you back in the day
Did my best to keep out of the way
You kicked it up in school
Singing out of tune
Thought you ruled the world
Singing out of tune
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
You're the ones to run from, or so they say
I remember you back in the day
Did my best to keep out of the way
You kicked it up in school
Singing out of tune
Everybody knew
Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune (a lot!)


I like the summer like you like your wife
Live in the "master" for the rest of my life
Every year since I was young
And always here and always fun
Distant places, staying faces
All I want, I understand is it's the summer
Over and over it's summer again
Fills up the sad hole in my head again
Several hours and passing faster
To lift their head down to the sand
Distant places, staying faces
All I want, I understand is it's the summer
And it's with it's flowers, and big huge skies
It gets high for hours, and then it dies
Ocean keeps me up all night
Sunshine makes my hair turn white
You know I hate the winter time
All because there's nothing quite like the summer
And it's with it's flowers, and breeses off shore
It gets high for hours, and then back for more
And it's with it's showers, and big big skies
It gets high for hours, and then it dies


And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
I find it funny, I laugh at people
And don't know why
I sometimes giggle, if there's an earthquake
Where good people die
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
I'll make the big man, I'll do what I can
I'll suffer for my sins
Speak with a deep voice, listen to metal
So that the good guys never win
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
Yeah you should see them all
When you sit in on Christmas day
But at six o' clock, on the sixth of June is OK
Got my life under the sun, pay for the things I've done
Pay for my mistakes
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
House under the ground
House under the ground
House under the ground
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here


Yeah yeah yeah I've seen it all
Yeah yeah yeah I've heard it all
J.P wants to rock, not at five o'clock hes not
There's a medal in the kitchen for catching early worms
Yeah yeah yeah you're gonna bet
Yeah yeah you're gonna learn
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Stevie knows that it ain't dead
Yeah Farmer uncle still in bed
M.A.C. was born to rock, there's not a moment that he's not
"A" communication, illin' in my sleep
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I lost count of my sheep
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Never, never looking back, never falling off the track
Never clocking late for work, 'cause rocking pays the bills
So I don't need no education
I don't need any sleep
yeah yeah yeah yeah I never need to set my "series 3"
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know

Well we did this once before, and we're giving it some more
And it's OK to be as you are you know
It's always five on one and you notice when we're done
That nobody got hurt, you're the same as what you were you know
I've got something for starters, throw it up in the air
And I bet you don't care, we're getting louder
It sounds ok to me on the desk at ICP
Roll the tape 'cos we're rocking album two
And our manager don't mind, 'cos we put all that behind
We've got another bite and you know the time is right to rock for you
I've got something for starters, throw it up in the air
And I bet you don't care, we're getting louder
Hey, it's another day in "A"
I'm proud to be myself 'cause rock me this way
I've got plenty more to say, so let me clear my throat
Cause I'm not cool Britannia
Not getting any younger, they hate me in NME
I don't care where you've been
I don't care for your scene, you make me feel like an amputee
I've got something for starters, throw it up in the air
And I bet you don't care, we're getting loud


There's nothing real about your fight
There's nothing in the shit you write
You've got charisma in your hair
The make-up lady put in there.. and it's
One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? ((1+2+3+4)x(2+2+3+4)x(2x3)+(2+4) = 666)
Bring it on the Monkey Kong, it's just a name they got it wrong
Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong
You're the captain of the team
You're the new king of the scene
You hire a guy to keep you punk
Laugh it up 'cause you don't know you're sunk
And Its One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? ((1+2+3+4)x(2+2+3+4)x(2x3)+(2+4) = 666)
Bring it on the Monkey Kong, it's just a name they got it wrong
Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It don't matter what you say, it won't change it anyway
You're not what you want to be
Every minute that you waste, when you're taking on the place
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong


Hey we're gonna be around
Hey we're gonna work it out
Hey there's nothing to fight about
Today we're gonna be about
You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe that you want me to stay
You're hoping that I'll go away
I'm gonna be around
Hey I'm gonna work it out
Hey there's plenty to fight about
No way I'm ever going down
You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe that you want me to stay
You're hoping that I'll go away
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, you think that you own me
You don't think I see you, you don't think you know me
You can tell me all the things you want to say
'Cause I'll get better anyway
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, you think that you own me
You don't think I see you, you don't think you know me
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
Hey


I don't know I'm born, I'm only young
I don't have a choice, you know I'm only young
I'm getting older, I'm getting smaller
Everybody tells you, "you've got to walk taller"
You did a war, and now you're poor
And like your friends, you're gonna get it in the end
You've heard it all before, you can't go on much more
It's not like I think:
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Can't put it off, you put it on, don't ever stop, it doesn't last long
The younger folks they don't understand
Back in the day, you're gonna get it in the end
You've heard it all before, you can't go on much more
It's not like I think:
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Fall down for no reason, the churches are heaving
The old folks they live their lives
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Fall down for no reason, the churches are heaving
The old folks they live their lives
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Fall down for no reason, the churches are heaving
The old folks they live their lives[Backing for last 2 verses]
Same as everybody 
It's coming back to haunt me 
It's on all the time 
Sitting in the summer 
The days are getting longer 
They don't remember why 
A cost to everybody 
They're always sad and lonely 
They live their lives


I want to feel important, want to think I'm worth it
Still feeling lame in the end
Sit in, in the evening talking to my robots
Still feel the same in the end
Spend a little time, spend a bit more cash, makes you feel aright
Want to know the truth, I feel the same as you do
Wake up in the morning, be careful what you ask for
It's never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing, let 'em do the talking
It's never gonna do in the end
I want to have a girlfriend, want a bigger garden
Still feeling lame in the end
Move to California, sell a million albums
Still feel the same in the end
Everybody knows, better than you know, it makes 'em feel alright
Want to know the truth, feel the same as you do
Wake up in the morning, be careful what you ask for
It's never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing, let 'em do the talking
It's never gonna do in the end[Answering Machine Message]
Wake up in the morning, be careful what you ask for

It's summer on the underground
So much sweat a man could drown
There's a panic on the overland
And London Bridge is falling down
The temperature is 92
It's baking in the vocal booth
All the tourists come in June
There's so many you can't move
There's people getting rich today
There's people that they've got to pay
There's lots of places I could go
We should be rocking in the studio
Don't feel like working today, I feel like getting away
Don't feel like driving today, I feel like getting away
Dalston is a wicked place
At weekends it gets off its face
And everybody calls you mate
But do they really want to know?
The drinks machine is running out
And please don't use that ticket touts
The ladies have it all on show
We should be rocking in the studio
Don't feel like working today, I feel like getting away
Don't feel like driving today, I feel like getting away
On my feet for a week thinking nobody cares
And I can't get to sleep thinking nobody shares
Are you taking to me? Get out of the way
We walk on the left and good manners are free
You don't have to pay
You know you just can't see, everything in a day,
Yeah I'm talking to you! Me? Yeah yeah I know
Back Here On The Underground
Back Here On The Underground

It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go
Save it for the Jury, 'cause I don't care anymore
You're not even worthy
It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go
I don't even know you, I don't even want to know
'Cause I think you're mental
It's a warning, that's as far as we go 
Warning, that's as far as we go

Coming back at you, record number two, what a way to start the day
Thinking big enough, with a stronger look
Got no back up plan in case we blow it
It's all the same old stuff, they think it's good enough
"It works" and nobody gets hurt
It happens every time, like anybody minds
They're telling me, "it's just the way it works"
Too much work to do, rocking new improved, keep it in the family
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It ain't broke so fix it anyway
Got a second chance and a fresh advance, what a way to start the week
Sack the formula, there's no need to bother
Got no backup plan, so let's not blow it up
It's all the same old stuff, they think it's good enough
"It works" and nobody gets hurt
It happens every time, like anybody minds
They're telling me, "it's just the way it works"
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It ain't broke so fix it anyway
Fix it anyway


Four long years ago, searching for the snow
We found the Tahoe lakes, just about the perfect place
50 Runs at 'Heavenly', and the nights at 'Squaw Valley'
Yeah, the trees are pretty wide, "That's where Sonny bono died"
All is quiet on New Years day, think I'll try and impress my mates
So I jump into the lake, I won't do that again, here we go again....
The south shore has the lot, and last month Dave Lee Roth did a solo spot
And some German bloke got shot, every year we say the same
"Try somewhere different for a change", but we jump on to the plane
Yeah, here we go again

Alright There Jason....theres somebody on the telly... on 15 to 1 right now, called Adam

Buy a junk?, delay that moon?, you think we feel the need to prove
That we play the fucking tunes, while you're the one that's fucking you
Now if you'd ever spared a day, at these things that don't fucking go away
You can see that our contract says that we get to do this our own way
Who can't challenge what you do? Don't be punks!
Who can't challenge where to go? Don't be punks!
And when will we change our tune? Don't be punks!
You can't tell 'em when and much! Don't be punks!
At this point you fucking loser, you don't have a fucking opinion


I'm down on the floor, there's a man at the door
He won't let me in 'cause he thinks he's the law
He'll give me a shout when he's figured it out
Gotta pick myself up, what am I waiting for?
It's never enough, yeah it's never too late
I reminded myself that I'm starting again
You're telling me "never", it should be "whenever"
And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time
Why can't I be just like the people that I know?
I've got what it takes, I'm bang up to date
You know how it is, I'm all over the place
Kicked in the face, I'm backstage, everyone here is half of my age
Standing in line, I'm hitching a ride
I'll give it a try but I don't have the time
You're telling me "never", it should be "whenever"
And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time

Pretty scary how they know you, it depends who you talk to
From the end to the beginning, only happy when we're singing
Smiling for the camera, crazy silly monsters, they think everything is great
Black and white not colour, eight times ten, no bigger, not tonight it ain't
You can try and put the face on, you can talk but it all goes wrong
You can put it in an album, like the "90's never happened"
Everything is easy, but they don't believe me, I think I deserve a say
Beds are made for sharing, but I'm way past caring, not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't[Break]
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't

Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Trying to remember, nothing lasts forever, live it before it gets too late
On the never ever, pretty good together, not tonight it aint


Your Miles Away
I'm Not messing about, got a mile of self doubt
Yeah, you're not even close, yeah
Because you're miles away
Another day in bed, sorting out your head
You don't know what you're talking about
You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
It's far from funny when you're falling over
Yeah, the robot voice, and the peoples choice
Yeah you blink and it goes wrong
Because you're miles away
You're not even warm, human after all
You don't know what you're talking about
You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
So far from funny when you're falling over
I'm too skint to pay my debtors, uh-oh un-opened letters
Feels like a siege I'm under, how did you get my number?
Oh-oh it's for the better, than on the never ever
I'll get back and back and back and back and back, around we go
You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
So far from funny when you're falling over
Miles away, no-one can stop me
It's far from funny when you're falling over [x4]


All your friends are famous, you're the man at pulling favours
Is that the best that you could do? Is that the best we can do?
You say it before, and say it again
"You're gonna be massive it's a matter of when"
Is that the best we could do? Do we owe it all to you?
You're getting around, you're getting me down
It's not that you're used to failure, you put the hours in the cheques come later
That's the best that you can do? It's time to take on something new?
You're moving in circles, you're all over LA
You're big with the ladies, so they don't think you're gay
Is that the best you could do? And do we owe it all to you?
You're getting around, you're getting me down
You're getting around, you're getting me down
And when it don't work out, you put them on the stand
Its not you're fault you got them eating from your hand
You say the words, and everybody leaves (I'm not "your boy" and that's not the point)
You change your hair, you fully rock a weave
You don't make sense and you don't want to know
You're self defensive, oh-uh
You're getting me down, you're getting around
You're getting me down, you're getting around
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?
You're getting around, you're getting me down [x28]


Nothing
And nothing's where you're at
When you ain't got something
You'll never get it back
It's coming on like a drug
The universal power of one
But it don't mean nothing
If it all comes undone (uh-huh)
Fly away
If you fly away
You might die today
If you fly
Fly
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
You're left with nothing
And nothing's what you've got
When you ain't got no-one, no-one
You could have had the lot
And if it's over today
You'll never get that thing you had together, no way
You only get it once
Fly away
If you fly, If you fly
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
We ain't got nothing
A day's a number
Don't remember how you found it
You will never feel the same
And forever have to take
It for granted, don't remember our mistake
We ain't got nothing
A day's a number
Don't remember how you found it
You will never feel the same
And forever have to take
It for granted, don't remember our mistake
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing


Somethings going on
I don't know what I did
But it worked out fine again 
Got you in my song
It sounds like a hit
It's gonna be alright again
We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on
Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on
Nothing's going right
This could go on all night
Gotta raise my game again
You're the same as me
I fit you perfectly
I'll never be the same again
We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on

Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on
Come on!
Something's going on
Oh yeah
Something's going on


6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio
The radioooo-oh 
Get out, get out, get out, yeah 
6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band, but he's got his eye on mine
There a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time - at any time! 
When my knees don't work, I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's OK
The daylight is that way
We all go the same way 
6 O'12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone! 
Get out, get out, get out yeah
Get out, get out, get out! 
When my knees don't work, I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's OK
The daylight is that way
It's alright, it's OK 
6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train


Air on the streets, lights on the trees
Eight days a week, singer's disease
I wanna be where the sun meets the sky
I wanna be there, it's out of your mind
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna piece of the air when I breathe in
I wanna be the gold underneath the stream
Having my moment, you know what I mean 
Ooooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 
Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.
I wanna stay here and never go home again
I wanna be the grass underneath your feet
I wanna be the shops on your high street
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna be your alarm when you sleep in
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud 
Ooooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 
Get a voice, don't get a doctor
That's your choice, no-one can stop you
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Got a job, I don't got no pension
In it for love - money's too tight to mention
I wanna be in the rockin'est city
I wanna do what I want if it kills me
Have to say, your home's where you make it
It's OK, I know when you fake it
I wanna be the gum on your train seat
I wanna stand up and walk on my own feet
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the rock underneath your ground
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one you can be around


Five pretty boys for ten shitty years
Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears
I need a reaction, a new revolution
All over the country, 'cos they took it away 
They took it away, it can't be impossible
They're playing the records that they play in hospital
Radio playlist for the terminally ill
You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away 
They took it away, left us with nothing
Second-hand hits and million misses
Nobody means it, they're making up stories
You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 
I blame myself, I want an easy life
Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away 
They took it away, left us with nothing
You suffer the pain of your fingers burning
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away


She's over it, she cannot take no more yeah
Don't wanna quit but that's a pretty nice door yeah
I got a bed, it really cost a fortune
I go away and it's too big without you
You've got it good, you know how good we've got it
You've got it bad, you know how bad we've got it 
I wouldn't swap it for a job in Starbucks
Wouldn't swap it for a job in Starbucks
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, I'll miss him when he's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is yeah
He works on automatic
Mr. Clean but i doubt it
He's got to have his say
Who needs him anyway?
Don't get your kind of music
He lets the others choose it
He thinks you kids are freaks
He wants you on the streets
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, I'll miss him when he's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is yeah
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, I'll miss him when he's gone
You don't know what it does to me
You don't know what it means to me
I take it as far as it goes
(I don't wanna know what I know)
It's too late to talk about it
I ain't changing any of it
Don't listen to us
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, you miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is yeah


Suck it up, we're going down
30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground
The passengers have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 
Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down, but then we just might
So this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 
Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care 
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 
We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 
I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays


So come out fighting, second's out
Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt
Got one thing on your brain, you all act the same
But you're alright
'Cos you are from Venus and I am from Mars
You'd like your penis as big as your car
Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!
Yeah, you're alright
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway
It's the way that you're scratching your balls when you walk
You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!
You're never wrong, so bring it on
'Cos you're alright
'Cos I are from Venus and you am from Mars
You buy me panties that don't match my bras
Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to
Then it's alright
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway
Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you
Beating you down with my words over you
You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental
But you're alright
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway


It's OK to beat the living shit from the drum kit
It's OK to take what you don't have, if you want it 
That's alright, that's your way
Water's cold, December, Del Ray
Through those eyes, made me cry
And the summer is forever
It's the endless summer 
And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you
Remember what I told ya
The night in California
And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 
It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean
It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 
Thanks a lot, you can be
What you want, honestly
Magic days, golden nights
And the summer is forever
It's the endless summer 
And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you
Remember what I told ya
The night in California
And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 
I don't need no explanation
All I got is best intentions
I got fears, too much to mention 
You're not there, when I'm scared, terrified
Jump right in, the water's fine


We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! 
Running out of luck
Trying to keep it punk
You can only let yourself down
Afraid of what you know
A square shape in a round hole
You know, it goes in tight,
Goes in tight
We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?
You're running out of time
You're never going nowhere
The best is all behind you
You're spending your cash like a man with no hands
Keepin' it real like your favourite bands
If they don't try
Then we don't buy, we don't buy
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up[SOLO!]
We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! Come on!
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
Yeah, come on!
We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! Come on!
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
Stand up


I'm so tired, I need sleep
I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?
I make mistakes, but them's the breaks
I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 
Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 
Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it? 
Life's a bitch, and so am I
If you want it bad enough, there's lots of easy ways to die 
Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 
Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it?
Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 
Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you, why can't you
So tough when no-one knows you
No homies, so lonely
Why don't you cry about it now?


Right back at you, record three
Makes you wish that you were me
'Cos we got no job for life
Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright
No two days turn out the same
Only sleeping on the plane
Not exactly Monkey days
C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 
Banshee wailing from my throat
Only dogs can hear the notes
Be myself to pay the bills
From L.A. to Skillmans Hill
We've done time for stealing shows
There ain't nothing we don't know
Plug us in and watch us go! 
C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 
Hot, like the desert sky
You're so cool on the inside
You hate being recognised
Going off on outside 
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 
Coming round for one more go
Way too loud for radio
Mosh pit full of casualties
OAP's get in for free
Time to even out the score
Thought we'd done enough before
Now we're kicking down your door 
Come on, rock it up, to the back
Measure twice, cut it once
Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on!


On and on like a Rush song, like a long one
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah the right one
There will come a day when Ill bury you
I will go the same way, together,
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough
Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming
Emo boy, naive and semi-functioning
Hey this is a love song, hands up if you feel it.
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
And the moment that's between us is everything
Don't say a word, that's not enough


Run around, 
What's the frequency you're on? 
Get around, 
That's addiction you'll get some. 
Heart attack, 
Not as big as the next one. 
Pulling back, 
Things look different when you're young. 
Can't find a, good reason. 
Can't fight this way i'm feeling. 
These jealous, teenagers, 
That laugh at my behaviour. 
You'd be better off without me, 
Hate to see you sorry, 
Days are closing in, 
You're better off with him. 
Its boring but i'm making, 
Promises i'm breaking, 
Days are growing thin, 
You're better off with, 
Anyone, 
Makes no difference just pick one. 
Get around, 
What's the frequency you're on. 
You're scared around, 
Conversations you're never wrong. 
You're better off, 
New relations, 
You're better off,

You'd be better off without me, 
Hate to see you sorry,

You're better off with him. 
Its boring but i'm making, 
Promises i'm breaking, 
Days are growing thin, 
You're better off with, 
I can't take it anymore, 
I can't concentrate. 
You run around, 
In my brain, yeah you run around 
You're not having fun no more, 
There's a thousand ways. 
You get around, 
In my brain, yeah you get around. 
Run around, what's the frequency you're on? 
Get around, what's the frequency you're on?

There's an angel on the corner 
And they say she's watching over 
Over when we are under 
Fall asleep on the ground [Pre chorus:]
Hey 
Can you feel it calling your name 
Like a storm on a bone in the rain 
The pain now going you're not around [Chorus:]
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense 
I gotta rock another city 
I gotta break another country 
I'm gonna kick it til i'm 50 
Or i'm deep in the ground [Pre chorus:]
Hey 
Not another bone for the pain 
I'm never drinking again 
It don't make sense when you're not around [Chorus:]
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense [Solo]
There's a devil on the road [x3][Pre chorus:]
I can feel it call your name 
The feeling that's keeping me sane 
Wide awake when you're not around [Chorus:]
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense

Lose yourself, save yourself. 
One more night, one more time. 
By yourself, no one else. 
One arrival time to hear you cry tonight. 
Pray today, slide away. 
And hide away, no one came. 
Holy graves, maiden names. 
Take a breath and hold it in and out again. 
And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. 
Take yourself, you hate yourself. 
Lie awake, wide awake. 
Bruise yourself, lose yourself. 
Pressure's on but not for long remind yourself. 
And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. 
Daylight's fading, angels waiting. 
Breaking all the plans we're making 
Daylight's fading, angels waiting. 
Breaking all the plans we're making 
And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. [fade last 4 lines]

Dirty fingers, please believe us
Everybody dies
Guilty perfect, murder suspect
That was not your crime
You never do nothing
(Hey)
And that's all you do
(Hey)
You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
The weight has been hard on your back
You're wearing well out of respect
Slowly it's dragging you down
I'd never call it that
You're running away and you feel
The voices are way too loud
You never do nothing
(Hey)
And that's all you do
(Hey)
You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
I can be sorry for this
So give me the pain I will swallow it
I can be taller than this
So light up the way, I will grow with it
I can hail Mary's for this
So I can remain always positive
I can be smarter than this
And then I can be on my
Way, way, falling for it positively
Moment that I saw you in the way
Oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
You never do nothing and that's all you do
You never get lonely and nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
Got no feeling, got no reason
Out of rhythm, feels like prison


Some days go on forever, 
Last long into the night, 
Some days feel like December, although its warm on the inside. 
Forget the middle of summer, 
I bet you I am alive. 
We'll wipe the floors together, nice try. 
Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 
Some days are complicated, 
Some ways i'll take the blame, 
Some days i take it all to, heart again. 
This place is made of panic, 
They check you every mile, 
Thank god you're going out for, a while. 
Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 
Nobody noticed what you're talking about, 
Nobody's got a clue what you're all about. 
Save it all. 
Save it all.

Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it.

Standing with a headache 
I try to fight but i cant deny the pain 
Reservations what i got from the bottom to the top 
On the bottle 5 times a day 
Standing with the top line 
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes 
And i'm shaking, and i feel so alive 
Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you 
When there's nothing on, 
You find yourself caught in the spotlight 
You try to fight but you cant delight the phase 
On your knees is what you're not 
Keeping what you got 
Don't try to hide your face 
Caught in a flashlight 
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes 
And i'm breaking, and i feel so alive 
Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you 
When there's nothing right 
When there's nothing right 
Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you

Never have I felt these feelings before

We'll find a solution to keep my heart close to you
And I know, yes I know
If you hold me, believe me

There is nothing that I would not do for you
Forever be true

IN A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING GOES

JUST LIKE A ROSE
AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE HOPE IS GONE
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH TO CARRY ON
EACH TIME I LOOK AT YOU
THERE'S SOMETHING NEW

HERE NEXT TO ME
TO WIPE AWAY MY TEARS

CAUSE I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME SOME SHELTER
CAUSE I'M FADING AWAY
AND BABY, I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN[CHRISTIAN:] EVERY SINGLE HOUR
OF EVERY SINGLE DAY

IT MAY BE HARD TO BELIEVE
BUT GIRL YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I NEED
IT MAY BE HARD ALONG THE WAY
IT'S THIS FEELING I GET

CAUSE I'M FADING AWAY
AND BABY, I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN[CHRISTIAN:] I SAID BABY, I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN

We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?
Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Oh the things that you say
Is it life or
Just a play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to 
remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway
Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two


I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You'll change
You'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2
You said you'd change
But I'm afraid
It's something I won't live to see
It's seems so strange
That sometimes fate
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game ( Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you
You'll change, you'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2
Because of you, I guess we're through
Is this the way it has to be
I've been a fool (Ben - I've been a fool)
A fool for you (Ben - A fool for you)
But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you
I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Instrumental break)
You'll change, you'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're still the same old brand new you
Another night, another day
What I can say
You break your promises in two
What can I do
Another night, another day
What I can say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
You're still the same old brand new you


You say we'll work it out, then you say you're having doubts. 
Tell me walk away, but then you'll go insane. 
Calling me day and night, saying he don't treat you right. 
Then you always turn around and give him one more chance.
Baby you know it isn't fair, you'll send me to be there. 
But we'd never get no-where.[Chorus:]
I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more. 
I'll make along so we shall, time too make up your mind girl. 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more. 
If I'm not what you want, I don't wanna hear no more. 
Stop telling me you need more time, tired of the same old line. 
Better make a move or you are gonna find, are you taking it. 
Cos you know it's wrong, better let him know it's time too go your moving on. 
Baby you don't know how close I am to being gone.
Really known you long enough, 
I can only take so much, tell me if I have you heart. 
(How do you really love) 
Baby you know it isn't fair, you send me to be there. 
But we never get no-where. [Chorus]
(I don't wanna hear no more) 
If your sure that you really love me. 
(I don't wanna hear no more) 
Out the door if you still don't know. 
I'll be there for you and you know it's true, 
you belong to me. What you go and do (I don't wanna hear no more)[Chorus Till End]


Could be your eyes, could be your smile. 
Could be the way you freed my mind.
Your precious touch caressed my soul. 
You gave me everything I need, and know I'll lost. 
Lost forever.[Pre-Chorus:]
Lost forever, and you said this is going nowhere, girl. 
And you said I turned my back on. 
You said I'll not the only one for you.
Please give me one more try for the sake of our love
Let's give it one more chance coz I can't give you up.
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
I could never find another like you.
Could be the lies, could be my pride. 
Could be the days and nights so wild. 
Could be the times I wasn't there. 
And all the nights we didn't share, and now you've lost. 
Lost forever[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
I can't sleep, I can't live without you by my side. 
So cold, so lost without as my guide. 
You made me realise I've nothing, nothing without you.[Chorus]
Baby give me one last try


You and me, we sit and talk of friendship then I ask. 
If you can see, if we could be together forever. 
I see the light die in your eyes
Coz you're scared you'll hurt. 
So you don't wanna try.[Chorus:]
Well take a chance and come home with me, you could stay for eternity. 
If you try then at least you'll see
Then you'll never regret the things we never did.
You turn to me, I see your eyes. 
And somehow they cease to shine, you smile at me yet I can see. 
You don't think we can make it
You see the light die in my eyes. 
Coz I'm scared to lose you, I wish you would try.[Chorus:]
I see the light die in your eyes
Cos you're scared you'll hurt. 
So you don't want to try.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Too bad baby, can this be, is there something wrong with you and me. 
Guess we'll see I confess I don't know how we got into this mess might have guessed. 
Day by day you're slowly running out of things to say. 
So I may ask you why is it always me who has to try. 
To make things feel right.[Pre-Chorus:]
You never told what you feel inside, I thought you loved me, now I realise. 
No matter how I try
You never seem to be satisfied. 
And now you're tellin' me it's...[Chorus: x2]
Too bad baby that you're so good to me, I like you, you love me. 
Too bad baby you're so into me, I can't breathe. 
You fall in love too easily.
Me and you, are slowly running out of things to do, nothing new. 
I don't know, just why we don't agree, when I say YES, and you say NO. 
Don't be shy, please tell why it is that we don't see
Eye to eye
So confused, I'm feeling helpless and I'm feeling used. 
Like yesterdays news, girl[Pre-Chorus][Chorus][Break]
It started from the day I met her
Walked over me I let her. 
Friends who told me go and get her
They're telling me forget her. 
Too bad baby, Think I'm going crazy. 
Someone take me
Nothings gonna save me.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Let me tell you about this girl that once was mine
Once upon a time she's nothing but trouble. 
Up till now, was a man of common senses. 
Funny on how I just give up on my defenses, but she's one of a kind. 
Just a girl that could easily twist your mind, but right now it feels so fine.[Chorus:]
She's nothing but trouble
Trouble's her name. 
She's driving me crazy, it's kind of insane. 
I'm searching for reason, to let her go. 
Cause somewhere inside of me I know. She's nothing but trouble.
Everyone says I'll playing a game with fire, it's too late I'll just caught up my desire.
Cause she's one of a kind, just a girl that could easily twist your mind. 
But right now it feels so fine.[Chorus]
When I look in her eyes, it's just hard to anyone's advice. 
But somewhere I realize.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


You used to say that everyday. 
We will always be this way. 
Flying Angels lifting high to reach the sun were I belong. 
Girl you know you are the one. 
Above the clouds I see you cry. [Pre-Chorus:]
You know that when you smile. 
You stop the rain and we will be together. Once again. [Chorus:]
Although I'm gone, remember me. 
Please be strong I'll never leave. 
Just hold on, to the memories. 
Coz while I'll here, all I'm thinking about is tomorrow. 
I'll always know the love you've shown. 
Means I'll never be alone
There'll be times you wonder why. 
But seeing you with someone new. 
Used to make me feel so blue. 
But know I'm with you, all the time. [Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
From the moment that I looked into your eyes. 
All of my life I thought I'll be there. 
By your side, I wish I'll took the time to find the words to say. 
You know when you stop the rain. 
And we will be together once again. [Chorus]
Coz while I'm here, all I'm thinking about is tomorrow.


When she passes me by, she's a ray of light. 
Like the first drop of sun from the sky. 
And I know she's a queen who deserves a king. 
But I'm not a king, and she doesn't see me. 
When she dances, she moves me to a smile. 
I see everything near her shine. 
There is a grace in her ways I can't contain. 
I don't have the grace, she doesn't see me. 
And the closer I get I can't help but hide. 
So ashamed of my body and voice. 
There are boundaries we pass in spite of war. 
But our own, we can't seem to cross. 
He has a way that surrounds him, so delicate. 
With a glory the reigns in his life, he is also so much that he is not. 
These things, they don't see and she doesn't see me. 
There are things we can change, if we just choose to fight
But the walls of in justice are high. 
When she passes me by, she's a ray of light. 
Like the first drop of sun from the sky. 
And I know she's a queen, who deserves a king. 
Someone other than me, she doesn't see me, 
She doesn't see me.


What's your favourite scary movie?
I've walked the jungle, fought a lion with bare hands. 
The prince of darkness I'm a far better man. 
I've walked the dessert never feared for my own. 
Where lightning strikes I'll always go.
Eye of the tiger not afraid to attack, like Frankenstein, flat on my back. 
That Witch's magic took nothing from me. 
Cos you're the one whose gotta spell over me.[Chorus:]
If you're looking for danger here I come, you'd better look out it's just begun. 
There's something that I want you to know. 
One thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you. 
Get these shivers down my spine, feel my body turning blue. 
The feeling is so frightening it's driving me insane. 
One thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you
The terminator said he will be back, fight fire with fire that's a natural fact. 
Tell me your nightmare, I'll give you my dream. 
I will protect you whenever you scream.[Chorus:]
If you're looking for danger here I come, you'd better look out, it's just begun. 
There's something that I want you to know. 
One thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you. 
Get these shivers down my spine, feel my body turning blue. 
The feeling is so frightening it's driving me insane. 
One thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you. 
(I could've swore I heard her screaming)
Because you're always there, to let me know. 
Sometimes we all get scared, I'm telling you I can't let you go oh!.[Chorus][while chorus is going second time round]
I can feel it in the air and my fever's going down. 
There's a chill across the town, uh-oh-ooh-hoh![Chorus:]
One thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you. 
I get these shivers down my spine, feel my body turning blue. 
The feeling is so frightening it's driving me insane. 
One thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you.


Believe in your heart
No matter what the people might say. 
The chance you take could take you to the top.
Listen up
You know you gotta throw your fear away. 
Together we can make it
Shake it up baby.[Break][Bridge:]
Hear the voices rock the nation
A calling to the skies I can see eternity is in your eyes. [Bridge:]
Come on everybody there's a party to go to. 
They're holding out for you! 
With every chance you take, a change you make. 
The start of something new.[Chorus:]
All around the world they are singing
Calling to the beginning. 
Oh oh oh celebrate our love, People with imagination. 
Everywhere a celebration. 
Oh oh oh celebrate our love!
Good to be free
Living out our own destiny. 
The best will last forever
Never stop.
Gotta move
You know we gotta groove into the light. 
Tonight will be the night that we're breaking it up
Break it down baby.[Bridge][Bridge][Chorus:]
Oh oh, oh oh, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na. Oh oh, oh oh 
Celebrate our love.
Let the rhythm take control
Feel the fire burn within your soul. 
There's a magic in your eyes
Forever we can take the music thru the night.[Repeat Chorus: Till End.]


Where have you been all my life? 
Where have you come from? 
Is this your first time too? 
It's like I've known you in some other lifetime. 
We're part of the great plan. 
Like two stars the shine.[Pre-Chorus:]
I stood here watchin', while it only ever happened to friends. 
Now I don't have to pretend.[Chorus:]
I can't believe we're living the dream
We're diggin that scene. 
We finally made it through the fire. 
Something 'bout you blows me away, like night over day. 
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah.
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
I've been waiting for you all my life
Anticipating with ever dream ever night. 
Destiny's moment we all share in time love is the message. 
And I know I've got mine¡-[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me?[Chorus][Outro:]
True love, true love. Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love. Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me?


I'm tired of fighting, got a fever when you try to get out. (Out, out, out) 
I've tried but I can't understand what all the fuss is about. 
I wish that I could be the man that you wanted me to be. 
I need you to see. [Chorus:]
I try and I try, yet I can't seem to fly. 
My soul full of pain when you cry, I wish I was perfect and god knows I try. 
But everything I do just tears your heart in two, I wonder why.
I never thought that being lovers meant that we can't be friends
If only I could understand what make you stay and stop breaking free from me
I wonder why.[Chorus]
Can't you see 
It's killing me, it's not the way things used to be. 
Can you remember yesterday, we used to smile without a care
Whenever you and I were near
Can't you see that I wanna be with you.
Oh baby! 
Oh oh oh, everything I do, tears your heart in two.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Don't speak, seal your lips. 
Please don't say a word, maybe I won't remember the words I have not heard. 
I see that you're in love, I know it's not with me. 
But I don't want the truth to haunt my memory.[Pre-Chorus:]
It's never too late to relight the fire
It's never stopped burning for me. 
The flame, it never died inside of me.[Chorus:]
How is it now that I can tell you I love you
How is it only now that it's too late. 
What can I do? 
The love that we had is torn in two. 
So you take the smiles from all of our years. 
I'll take the tears.
I sit and reminisce of times that we once shared. 
You gave me more than love. But never thought I cared. 
My feelings were all for you. 
Although it didn't show. 
I only told you on the day you let me to go.[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
Now I realize that you're no longer mine. 
But I'm hoping that the pain will ease in time. 
Although you're leaving, I won't say goodbye. 
Because I know you're here with me inside. [Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Have you seen the sunset, fade beneath a rain cloud? 
Have you ever chased your dreams away?
Did you ever think that? 
Life was just a highway, a never-ending road of lonely days. 
There are times we cry, and reach out to the sky. 
For the strength we need, to hold our head up high.[Chorus:]
All we need have to do now is love one another. 
Sisters and Brothers, can all live as one. 
And all we have to do now is show one another.
We all need each other, to love as on in love.
Have you seen a sunrise, promising you daylight?
When all you need is shelter from the storm. 
Have you ever felt that love was just an island
You can't survive on love all on your own.
There are times when I need to reach inside. 
For the strength I need, to hold my head up high.[Chorus]
If we push aside the blame, for the tears and the pain. 
You know love can reign, and the world will smile again.
If we push aside the blame, for the tears and the pain. 
You know love can reign, and the world will smile again.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


[Paul:] You said that love was just a state of mind 
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find 
And for me you never really had the time 
I was blind. [Christian:] And everything that you meant to me 
Is written in the pages of my history 
But it's over now as far as i can see 
Suddenly [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [Mark:] Moving on she brings me brighter days 
Thoughts of you are in my mind always 
Like a memory that i can't erase 
It's here to stay [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [All:] So different 
([Mark:] it's so different) 
So easy 
([Paul:] so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
([Ben:] i can't get over you) 
So different 
([Paul:] it's so different) 
So easy 
([Mark:] so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
([Ben:] and i can't get over you) [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
And now i'm caught 
Caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
And now, i'm caught in the middle


When you're weary, When you're down and out
Lay your hands on me [x2]
I count my blessings, think of all I have
She never thought about it then threw it all away
Left it all to chance, She tore down fences
Now it seems so wasted wish she could turn back time.[Chorus]
Now she's down on her knees to pray
Baby please make it good, make it good somehow
She will do anything to change
So please make it good, make it good somehow
Someone please
When you're weary, when you're down and out
Lay your hands on me
had a vision. Time to make a stand
for all she is to me, to turn her life around
To take back yesterday's never easy
When you're wrong you're wrong. It seems impossible so[CHORUS]
Welcome to your revoloution 
What you dream is what you see
There's no rules or regulations
Let the music set you free[Chorus]
When you're weary, When you're down and out
Lay your hands on me [x2]


There's a chill in the air
Looks like the winter is returnin'
You know I have to stay 
Until I find a way to get through this
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
Now there's no healin' without some kind of pain
Hey baby, things have got to change
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain
I left it all to chance
Maybe the odds were all against me
Now it's out of my hands but I will see it through if you let me
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
And there's no healin' without some kind of pain
And you tell me baby, we can't go on this way
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain
When the truth behind the lies
All the dreams we left to die
Were just rivers runnin' dry
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain


Sunday morning time to say goodbye
But I'll be home real soon
Though I'm leavin', girl don't start to cry
I'll be thinkin' of you .... yeah
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again
How can i sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with the tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you
Oh yeah, baby, oh
Now time and healin'
Another week come by
Girl it feels like years, hmmm...
I've been callin' every day and night
How i wish you were here,  ooh yeah..
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again
How can i say when my words run dry
How can I smile with the tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you
I never met a girl who is so this sweet
Can't wait to see you again, oh oh
I never had a love that was so complete
And you know that I'll be dreamin' 'til then
Oh, baby...
I said the time is now, baby...
How can I say when my words run dry (how can i say)
How can I smile with the tear in my eye (tear in my eye)
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you
Wooh yeah baby.. (how can i smile)
I said yeah, I said I'm missing you..(ooohh )
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June (ah)
That's how it feels (that's how it feels)
When I'm missing you

Crazy
The crazy things I heard you say  I’m mad about you all the same 
I never really saw the crime Yet went ahead and served my time
I never met someone like you before  But sometimes that is not enough
Cuz I can’t help just feeling
I must be crazy for leaving you Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you 
I will regret this chosen mind I never wanna see you cry
I care about u endlessly u deserve a deeper love than me
I don’t know if I’ll make it on my own But I tried so hard to let it go
And I can’t hide this feeling
And I know that I will miss you like a fool But there’s something in my life
And I can’t hide this feeling I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you


When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see that’s not the way
The story has to end 
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you’re on the wrong track
Give it time, you’ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You’ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you’ll learn to fly
In your head, so many questions
The truth is your possession
The answer lies within your heart (within your heart)
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope
And you will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see that’s not the way
The story has to end
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you’re on the wrong track
Give it time, you’ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You’ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you’ll learn to fly
Looking at your situation
There’s so much that you can do
Now’s the time to make your stand
This is just an observation
In the end it’s up to you
The future’s in your hands
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you’re on the wrong track
Give it time, you’ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You’ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you’ll learn to fly
Give it time
Then you’ll learn to fly


This punky clubwas spinning fores off a funky tee
I'm on the floor and she's watching me
Guess she was fine with a head to thigh inspection
With my back against the wall I play it casually
Man, I don't know but when she smiled at me
And started grinding her arse on the horn of some dirty trumpet
I had to say something
Camera shy, no style, getting it right I said I wanna take you home, tonight.
And she said
*Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture.
Love me if you like, but I'm not what you need.
And nothing comes for free. Isn't it cheap
As soon as she got me alone there was no(huh) hesitation
And she started taking off all her clothes to Lady Paris singing
I was jacking her up all night with a lethal injection
The way she alomost put up a fight, was so close to perfection
Tired eyes, no ties, turn on the light I want to see what gets you hot, tonight.
And she said[Repeat*]
isn't it cheap, when I'm down on my knees.
Talking sweet just to meet your demands. See your
delight as your stealing my night
Just to play it straight in to my hands[Repeat*]


Another picture on the wall
Another life I used to live
Another meaning once untrue
With every memory of you
Broken in my sleep
Another moment lost in time
You talked of love and I agreed
So many chances passed us by
And now I've lost the strength to try
Your love was never mine to keep
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed
If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
With every night I lie awake
With every day we grow apart
Is there a promise we can't break
We never learn from our mistakes
From the very start
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed
If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
Don't look back on yesterday 
Cuz the time has been and gone
Think of what tomorrow holds
Without you it feels so wrong
I can't carry on
If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
Oh no
If I can't have you


She's all alone
Making her way to a cold, empty home 
Nobody waiting and no one to hold
She's holding her own 
He wakes up late
Stares at the mirror to find his own face 
Picks out the pieces he hides from within 
He doesn't fit in, do you?
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Opens her eyes
Looks around her 
There's faith in disguise 
There's no more secrets to shadow with lies 
She swallows her pride 
Somebody care, hard to be seen when there's nobody there 
It's getting closer, no need to pretend 
Just let it in and believe 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Maybe today or maybe tomorrow 
Guess the hands of fate
Been making you wait too long 
I know the way to forget all your sorrow 
Be the first in line to admit that you were wrong 
Sometimes 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night


Sorry for making you cry 
For turning away 
As you walk on by 
But baby I need to be strong 
And I need to move on with my life 
You know it's not that I don't care 
So don't make me feel bad
It's not fair 
Baby you know all the reasons 
I made my decisions in life 
Now a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do 
And a boy had to become a man 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
You know it's not easy to do 
Turning my back on me and you 
But baby I need someone there 
Who will love me and care for my life 
Smiles they turned into tears 
And all of my dreams
They all disappeared 
Baby this cannot be right
So I'll turn down the light 
On our love 
Now a boy's gotta do
What a boy's gotta do 
And a girl had to do what she can 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you 
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
And everything that could gone wrong 
Has gone wrong at some time 
Now I can see the light 
It was love at first sight 
And I'm not gonna let this girl go 
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
>From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
Yes I Will
With you


Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
So beautiful , we had it all
No use looking to the past
We both knew it wouldn't last
But it was fun we had a blast
So beautiful, as I recall
Where did it go yeah...
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad
But they don't have to know
Do you remember singing, now?
Breaking rules we always would
Doing things we never should
We were so bad but it felt so good
Do you remember I think you remember
I wonder where you are tonight
But I know that you'll be alright
'Cos I see our star is shining bright
It's so beautiful, it will never fall
Where did you go
Come on now, sing it loud
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your guy'd get mad
But they don't have to know, yeah
Do you remember singing, now?
Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
So beautiful, we had it all
Where did it go 
Come on now, sing it loud
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your guy'd get mad
But they don't have to know
Do you remember singing now?


Take my hand, touch my face
Let me feel your embrace
Let me see in your eyes
That you won’t say goodbye
Just tell me how you feel
I don’t know what you’re thinking anymore
And if you need me, you’d kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you’d show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You’d hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I’m feeling strong
I sing you one last song
Let me ask time has passed
Do you feel this could last
If you don’t, why then stay
Take your wings, fly away
I love you way too much
To wanna be the one who brings you down
And if you need me, you’d kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you’d show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You’d hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I’m feeling strong
I sing you one last song
One last song I sing for you
Like I always did
This time it’s for real
I never come to you like this
Expecting you to turn my kiss
Oh no no no no no
And if you need me, you’d kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you’d show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You’d hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I’m feeling strong
I sing you one last song
Oh yeah
I sing you one last song
I sing you one last song


[Mark:]
You said you need a groom this evening 
I told you I'm leaving 
Till you begged me to stay 
You got your high heels on to tease me 
You promised to please me 
Then you take it away [Mark:]
The fire is fading baby stoke it up 
And let it roll up your sleeves 
Why can’t you tell me that we're breaking up 
And that I need space to breath [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [Mark:]
Let it in[Paul:]
You used to keep me up till the morning 
Keeping me warm untill I had to be gone 
And now you can’t find a room in your head 
You see you got out of bed 
Well that my coffee ain't on [Paul:]
The door was open do you locked it up 
And then you threw out the key 
Why can’t you tell me that we're breaking up 
That I need space to breath [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [All:]
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait 
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait  [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [All:]
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [Mark:]
Let it out [Paul:]
No I can’t wait 
Till you let me in 
I can’t wait [Mark:]
No I can’t wait 
You got to let it out


You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
And for me you never really had the time
I was blind, oooh- oh
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
Moving on she brings me brighter days
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Like a memory that I can't erase
It's here to stay, Wo-oooh
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
(So different) Nos différences
(So easy) So easy
(But I can't get over you) Plus rien ne t'efface
(So different) Nos différences
(So easy) So easy
(But I can't get over you) Plus rien ne t'efface
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
And now, I'm caught in the middle


What have I become
I wish that I could go some place
Where nobody knows you now
Nobody knows you now
Nobody knows you
This heart it weighs a ton
Some memories you can't escape
And nobody shows you how
Nobody shows you how[Chorus:]
Yet I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday
I don't want friends around
Still I don't wanna be alone, no no
Somebody hold me now
Somebody hold me now[Chorus:]
Cause I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday
Sometimes
A sinner becomes a saint
Sometimes
Believers can lose their faith 
Sometimes
We learn from our mistakes[Chorus:]
So I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday


I can feel that the wheel is in motion
And there's life in this old timer yet
Looking back there's a new reflection
Now I know what you give is what you get
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
‘Cause I don't wanna lose you again
Now I bet that your ears are burning
With three words on the tip of my tongue
I just hope that your heart is open
So that I can undo what I've done
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
‘Cause I don't wanna lose you again
Like a star, it's so hard to reach you
Not enough just to call you a friend
And I know that I don't deserve you
But I don't wanna lose you again, oh
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
‘Cause I don't wanna lose you again
No, I don't wanna lose you again


You are like the ocean
And you're drowning me
The sunrise casting shadow
As far as I can see
'Cause you're so bitter sweet[Chorus:]
I'm in love, I'm in love
And I hate it
I'm in love and so overrated
What am I supposed to do
I wanna be with you
I'm in love, I'm in love, I can take it
I'm in love and feel so naked
What am I supposed to do
I wanna be with you
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it
I hate it
Sometimes I feel spineless
I can't stand up straight
And sometimes I'm so stupid
I make the same mistake
But I can walk away[Chorus]
It's the agony, It's the extasy
And it's stolen me, And it's killin' me
And it's killin' me
I'm in love, I'm in love[Chorus]
I'm in love And I hate it
Hate it


Baby come back, hear me out
Is there any way to reach you now
Sitting on the edge thinking out loud
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know
Crying out loud, I wanna do good
I do it all for you if I could
The way it looks now from where I stood
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know
But running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
Take a little time think this through
See it from another point of view
Putting myself in any old shoes
Maybe there is somewhere that you go
Somewhere that only you go
Trying to move on, all the way down
Waiting for your head to hit the ground
Whatever you're in we'll figure it out
I'll tell you there is something I do know
That wherever you go
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad [x4]
If you want it bad enough
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head (you can fight this illusion)
All in your head (all in your head)
All in your head (you can fight, you can fight)
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head (you can fight this illusion)
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head
You can fight it
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough [x2]


Photographs in a card board box
Remind me I can't turn back the clocks
So far now from the starting blocks
I still don't know what this key unlocks
I say who
Made you give it away
Say who, Oh no
There's nothing left to say[Chorus:]
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now
Spiraling down
Memory lane I went
Hitting it hard
To hammer out the dents
No more sitting on a broken fence
It's to rebuild my confidence
I say who
Made you give it away
I said who, Oh no
There's nothing left to say, heh[Chorus:]
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now
We dance, we fall, we lose it all
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all
Nice to see that you're doing well
You're happy now as far as I can tell
We soldier on with the hands we're dealt
We're strangers now to the way we felt[Chorus: (2x)]
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now 
We dance, we fall, we lose it all
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all


[Christian:]
I'm gonna take this chance to be up all night
I wanna fix this up just the way you like
I wanna shake the weight of the world, that's right
I gotta make the most of this old street light
And if you think I'm talking too much just tell me
If you need to change the pace then help me
We've got ten more minutes to go
I said, we've got ten more minutes before we go[Mark: (Ref)]
There's no regrets
At least not yet
And it's safe to go
I heard it on the radio
So I'll take you home[Ben:]
You know I need somebody to love me yes
You know that I won’t settle for second best
We gotta live like that ignore the rest
So if they all go east, then we'll go west
You know I dance my life to a different beat
And I like it here on the edge my seat
And now the stage is set, and we're alone
Where we end up later, we don’t know[Ref]
I take you home
Well, I take you home
And if it gets to crowded then may I suggest
That when they all go east then we'll go west
C'mon lets go, go, go
And where we end up, we dont know!
There's no regrets
At least not yet
And it's safe to go
And I heard it on the radio'[Ref]


I'm mad, still mad about you
It's too bad, I'm bad without you
Don't touch
you've already said too much
Pick and collect your stuff
T-shirts and your toothbrush
Cos that's all you've got 
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground
Lovesick, but I'm still sick of you
I quit, was too quick to love you
Don't touch
you've already said too much
Come back and collect your stuff
T-shirts and your toothbrush
Cos that's all you've got 
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground
There's no way back this time
So we gotta leave it all behind
Oh, oh, ohh
oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, ohh
oh, oh, ohhh
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground
You can't keep what you're throwing away
(there's no way back this time)
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to see
(So we gotta leave it all behind)
Our love is six feet underground
You can't keep what you're throwing away
(there's no way back this time)
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to see
(So we gotta leave it all behind)
Our love is six feet underground[Repeat to fade]


I know a girl with a broken smile
He's been hurting her for quite a while
But she loves him
She still loves him
I've got a friend with a heart of gold
He loved his wife even when he was told
She's unfaithful
He still faithful
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know
Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it
I've seen a man working all his life
Lose his job to a new device
Still he's grateful
Yeah, he's grateful
I know somebody who's got all they need
Who built an empire stepping on the weak
Still ungrateful
So ungrateful
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know
Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it
Who decides this?
It seems so unfair
Is there somebody
Somebody out there?
Who decides this?
Does anyone care
Is there somebody
Somebody out there? [x4]
Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it


Some of us were born to break
The slightest knock is all it takes
I'm sleeping while I'm wide awake, woah
I've tried to thicken up my skin
I'm having trouble fitting in
I'd rather sink than never swim, woah
Now all my life I have learned
It's me just me against the world[Chorus:]
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster
Everytime I talk I choke
I hide behind the songs I wrote
It's killing me with every note, woah
Will all my fears be confirmed 
Is it me just me against the world[Chorus:]
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster
As far as I am concerned
It's now you and me against the world[Chorus:]
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster


I meet someone the other day
It's good to see her face again
She's the one who got a way
Way back when
Showed photos of her family
Soon to marry mum to be
She used to want all that with me
And she smiled and I laughed[Chorus:]
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would I be standing at the altar by her side?
Would her child be mine?
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
She's happy now and that's a fact
And who am I to mess with that
So I won't try to get her back
In a way I'm glad
'Cause that was then and this is now
Still I can't help but think about
All the things that I'm without
But I wave the white flag[Chorus:]
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would I be standing at the altar by her side?
Would her child be mine?
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
And as she was walking away
I thought I saw her
Turn back and hesitate
Look at me as if to say
I imagined if you didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would you be standing at the altar by my side?
What would our child look like?[Chorus:]
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would I be standing at the altar by her side?
Would her child be mine?
And it's the strangest thing
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
The Life That Should Have Been


Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze
Wanna improvise with you
Put the world to rights with you
Let me put your mind at ease[Chorus]
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
Out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...
Come and raise a glas with me
Reminisce and laugh with me
Go for broke and paint with me
Come on roll the dice with me
Flip the bird to life with me
We can turn this all around[Chorus]
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
And there's more than enough to spare
There's a whole lotta love out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...
All I'm saying is
Climb the wall you've been facing
Catch the wave you've been chasing
We've got something to live for now
Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze[Chorus]
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
And there's more than enough to spare
There's a whole lotta love out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...


I miss your breathing
When sleep doesn't come
I cant help pretending you'll be home
I cant face the future
Now your in the past
Seems all of the best things never last[Chorus]
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
They say I get through this
But how could they know
How can I make it on my own
Your here in the shadow
You cover my heart
And I hear you whisper in the dark[Chorus]
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
I don't wanna let you go
But in time
But in time
I'll wake up for all I know
I'll be fine[Chorus]
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come


Baby don’t, baby don’t, treat me right
I better get, better get outta sight
Guess my dinner’s in the dog tonight
Shouting out, shouting out at me all night
Ringing in my ears till the morning light
Baby just wanna have a fight tonight
Alright, it’s okay
Tomorrow’s another day
I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try
Baby don’t, baby don’t break away
Hear me out, hear me out, what I say
I can’t take it for another day 
Burning up, burning up, baby stop
Cool it down now before you blow your top
I guess the dog’s back sleeping in my spot
Alright, it’s okay
Tomorrow is another day
I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me 
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try
Just trust me
Try


Standing in line, talking ‘bout nothing
When you walk right by
And I wanna say something but 
I’m so shy it hurts
You don’t see me if I gave you my compass
Then would you be more like Christopher Columbus
And explore my world
Hey now I’ve gotta tell you
No I’m bursting to tell you
I can’t keep it inside
Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come knock knock on my door
So the secret’s out I’ve been discovered
I’m feeling vulnerable my heart’s uncovered
But there’s no reply
I’ll still be here
I’ll still be waiting
I’ll keep a look out until your ship comes sailing in
Will you ever be mine
Hey now how can I show you
I’m bursting to tell you
I can’t keep it inside
Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door
Am I too late
Have you been discovered
I wish I’d been more like Christopher Columbus
And found you first
Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door


I got it wrong I made you angry so it seems
Say I’m a douche bag 
But I don’t know what that means
I’m in the doghouse baby please throw me a bone
You need some space but I can’t bear to be alone
And I don’t know how to control your temper
Just breathe in breathe out
I don’t like it when you sit there quiet
Say it’s nothing but I just don’t buy it
Think there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know what’s coming
Yeah, there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
I tried to call you like a hundred times today
You’re so black and white
When I’m all different shades of grey
I come around to see you but it only makes it worse
This won’t be our last fight 
And it sure hell ain’t the first
I wanna hear you shout 
Let go of your temper
Just breathe in breathe out
I don’t like it when you sit there quiet
Say it’s nothing but I just don’t buy it
Think there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know what’s coming
Yeah, there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
I don’t like it when you sit there quiet
Say it’s nothing but I just don’t buy it
Think there’s gonna be a riot
A riot

Is Anybody there? I come up for air
Feels like I’m drowning
Does anybody care?
It makes no sense at all
Such a long way to fall.
I knew it was coming
I could feel it in the air
Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I've fallen from grace
Is anyone around?
My head hits the ground
I feel like I’m no one
I’m lost in the crowd
It makes no sense at all
So divided we fall
I’m breaking my silence
But you don't hear me call
And you don’t see me fall
Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I've fallen from grace
And everyday just feels the same
I try so hard to walk away from everything I am
Just closing in on me
I just can’t face the pain
I sit around and wonder why?
So many dreams can fade and die
Well nothing is forever everything is never
And I can’t say goodbye
Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I’ve fallen from grace


Starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking out on the same sky starlight
Everybody gets down sometime
When I get down I turn to rhyme
I write lyrics like diary 
When the words come out yeah it's good for me 
But every body needs a little help
When you lost for words and you can't help yourself
Just step out to your balcony and
Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking on the same sky starlight
Why (do) you lost your confidence
You're beautiful, it don't make sense to me
It's been a while since I've seen you laugh
Last time you face it for a photograph
And when there's no one to hold ya
And you're all out of hope 
Just remember what I told ya
Just step out to your balcony and
Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining up for you
We'll looking at the same sky starlight
Every night in a way you'll find me
I'm in the sky the moon beside me
Just look around and they're out here 
Waiting waiting for you [2x]
I'm waiting for you [3x]
Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We'll looking out on the same sky starlight
Every night in a way you'll find me
Just look around and they're out here 
Starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking out on the same sky starlight


Your eyes they tell me something
I heard a rumor saying you're alone again
On your own again
That really got me thinking
I know that you're looking for love but maybe
Until then you just need a friend
We don't have to tell nobody
Our secret safe don't worry
No string no complication
It's just a win-win situation
Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]
Go separate ways when leaving
Both know when later you'll be home with me
Be alone with me yeah 
No heart that we're deceiving
No harm in what we're feeling
As long as we don't think of what could be
We don't have to tell nobody
Our secret safe don't worry
No string no complication
It's just a win-win situation
Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]
Go out go out
Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]


No more drama 
I'm going under 
With your face so full of thunder 
Lay it on me Evidently 
There's an elephant in the room 
Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me cause it's killing me 
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
When it comes down 
To the wire 
One spark can start a fire 
So come on now 
Let it all out 
Before my heart goes tick tick boom 
Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me cause it's killing me 
Think about how eleven letters 
Mean the world when they're put together 
They can change our lives forever 
Say them now cause it's now or never
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
I forgive you (ahhhhhhhhhh)
You'd save my life
I forgive you [2x] (ahhhhhhhhh)
You'd save my life...


I used to be stardust
Then came the big bang
Then I turned to mountain the bed rock the sand
Chiseled and broken
Shaped by a man
Turned into weapon in his hands
Too many stones [3x] have been thrown
A piece of a bridge
A break in a wall
I can be anything at all
A tip of an arrow
The very first wheel
I held the command and always will
Too many stones [3x] have been thrown
So lay me down, build a path
Walk on me together
Let me be your common ground
And hold on to each other
Lay me down
Lay me down oh
Too many stones have been thrown
Too many stones [3x] have been thrown
Oh lay me down
Too many stones (Lay me down)
Too many stones (just lay me down)
Too many stones have been thrown
Too many stones (just lay me down)
Too many stones (too many stones)
Too many stones have been thrown
A piece of a bridge
A break in a wall
I can be anything at all


When I'm Grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Like a ship against the tide
Still I know, there's a simple truth
I am Grateful
When I hear the saddest song
In that moment
I know I am not alone
Someone else, feels the same way too[Chorus]
To be Grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be Grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break
Ever Grateful
For the scars along the way
And I'm thankful
For each mistake I've made
Cause somehow, It all led me to you[Instrumental][Chorus]
To be Grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be Grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break
When I'm Grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Still so good to be alive
Cause I know, I shared it all with you

I feel the joy in this Christmas time
But something's missing in this heart of mine
The Choirs sings that the season's here
I always miss you this time of year
It's crowded out in Trafalgar square 
But it feels so empty when you're not there
They're all waiting for snow to fall 
But I'm still waiting for a miracle
I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
If New Year comes and my gifts still there
The lights come down and the tree is bare
I'll keep it wrapped til December then
I'll place it under the tree again
I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
Christmas morning finally 
I run downstairs excitedly
Then to my surprise I see
The greatest gift in front of me
You left your heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas 
You left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time


I watched the ice melt away
I saw the cold wind change
But like in an old snow globe
In my world, it's always winter
As flakes settle to the ground 
You turn me upside down 
And back to start I go
In my world, it's always winter[Chorus:]
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
Resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
Waiting farewell
To Another Year Gone
Here on your window sill
It's as if time stood still
I'm stuck in this wonderland 
But it's all fake
It's only glitter [Chorus:]
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
Resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
Waiting farewell
To Another Year Gone
Be careful how hard you shake
Cause one day this glass will break
Water will flow like tears
And I'll sail away on that river[Chorus:]
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
All by myself
Another Year Gone

She loves you yeah...... yeah..... yeahh.......


I can’t help but I wanna be around you
Can’t forget about my home
When I’m lonely
You might not know but I always think about you
As you fall upon your soul
I wanna thank you
Home is where I belong
It’s a place, I’m taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on
Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down
You’re always around when I have some time to steal
When I need some time to heal 
For remedy (for remedy)
And there are times when it’s hard to be myself
Turn me into someone else
But you know me
Home is where I belong
But it’s a place, I’m taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on
And on and on
Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Stay around
Come on down
Come on down
Call on to please me tonight in a while
Just so I’m kind when I’m home
Days turn to seasons and years have gone by
Hold on
Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down[Instrumental]
I said come on down
Coz there’s a fire in my heart
I said and you’ll look down
Just I need you here right now
You gotta come on down
And bring me back to solid ground
Come on down


Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love [2x]
We can stay up all night by the moonlight
Watch the sunrise with the butterflies
We can fight all night, we can yell and cry
We never say goodbye
We're always side by side
I will go where you go
Side by side
We are two, forever
Together we will grow
This is our fight
It's now or never...
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love [4x]
Some days we are afraid of waves
Some days we surf 'em!
You and me, we have our days
And I don't wanna lose them
I will go where you go
Side by side
We are two, forever
Together we will grow
This is our fight
It's now or never...
So..
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love [4x]
We can, we can fall down,
Down, down, down
We never, we never hit the ground
Ground, ground, ground
Somehow (somehow), we always get up
Up, up, up (yeah)
Sometimes (sometimes), even to the top (even to the top...)
I will go where you go
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)


Today when I saw you 
I knew it was just like the first time
When you met my eyes I came close
And I felt like the first time
To hold back my fear
and feel you so near
I’ve never been this far before
To hold back my fear
and feel you so near
I’m scared of falling into deep this time
Do I need a reason to tell you why
I’m singing you this song
Do I need a reason to show you that
I know where I belong
Whenever I am weary I lean on
this feeling that I have
I am so much stronger now
Thankful, yes I am
Today I’ll renounce them,
the doubts and the fears I’ve been nursing
I’ll fly like a moth to the flame
and I’ll feel like the first time
To hold back my fear
and let you come near
I’ve never been this far before
To hold back my fear
and let you come near
I’m ‘fraid of loosing and still I go


You just found heaven,
It's safe to say you'll do it again.
It's been a while since you needed a shoulder to cry on,
Now you're coming to me for a helping hand,
You're out all night fooling around,
It just ain't right the way you're letting her down,
It's the same old story time after time.
Take a look at your life, 
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just can't get it right,
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
How can you turn your back on the girl you rely on,
Then you leave it to me to try and turn it around,
Now you're up all night, head in your hands,
How can I help you understand,
It's the same old story time after time.
Take a look at your life (take a good look),
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again (you know you'll do it again),
You just cant get it right (oh no you cant),
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
I can't believe you did it again,
Your only breaking your heart like this,
Till it's tearing you apart and then,
You're right back where you started. 
Now you're up all night, head in your hands,
How can I help u understand,
It's the same old story time after time,
Oh baby.
Take a look at your life (take a good look),
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just cant get it right (oh no no no),
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
Take a look at your life, 
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just cant get it right,
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.


Put it on to me
I can hear you baby
'Cause we've been
Here once before
I can feel the heat
Don't you feel it baby?
And it makes me
Want you more
Didn't you tell me yesterday
We gotta take it all the way
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
'Cause I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it, ooh
And now
You're close to me
We got to move together
And I've never
Felt so sure
Your sexuality,
I'm in a love hangover
The rhythm of your body
Is the only cure
Carried away
Like butterflies
Feeling the music
Takes you high
Baby, You know we're
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
'Cause I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it, ooh
I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it,
I like it
Go for the stars
And feel the sky
We gotta do
That everytime
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop[Repeat to fade]


I keep trying 
Ain’t no denying
We should be together now
I can’t imagine
You’re with another man
Baby, it can be wrong
To play with, in this love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
You can’t hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
You can’t hide your love
(Hide your love)
(You gotta hide your love)
I can remember
Last time you needed me
I’m always here left to know
And when it all goes wrong 
And things are not the same
I’m always your price to pay	
But I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
You can’t hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
You can’t hide your love
(Hide your love)
(Hide your love, oh my)
Can we, in this love
Yes I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
All of this time
You can’t hide your love from me
(From me, deep inside…)
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
(Walk away, if you wanna stay)
You can’t hide your love


[Ben]
Maybe I don't even exist
So I'll stay anonymous
It's over and the situation shouted in shame
And they say it's down to us
But what do they know[All]
So write, this time
Till it's starting or ending
I'll never get tired of your lies[Ben]
But what you've got to visualize[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry[Ben]
Either get it high or go dry
This time[Paul]
I see you're playing that song again
You never show your hand 
To let me in[Paul]
You keep it all inside yourself
And cry to no one else
But I catch your tears[All]
So I write[Ben]
So I write,this time
This time
Till it's starting or ending ([Ben:] starting)
I'll never get tired of your lies[Paul]
But what you've got to visualize ([Ben:] oh, oh)[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
Either get it high or go dry[Paul]
Either get it high or go dry[Mark]
You say this love will see another day
But at least tonight
You'll be mine[All]
So I write ([Mark:] so I write), this time ([Mark:] this time)
Till it's starting or ending ([Mark:] starting or ending)
I'll never get tired of your lies ([Mark:] oh, oh)[Paul]
But what you've got to visualize[All]

[Chris:] Fallin' for a fantasy
I threw away my destiny
I don't know where to stop
Feelin' broken-hearted
I'll think about it
And to see my eyes 
To cry to dry
for I've forced
All this time [2x]
With you, ooh...[Chris:] I was tempted by the power of desire
I surrendered to the calling of the fire
There's nothing I could ever say
to change the things I did
But I promise you
I'll make it up to you[Mark:] Take me back to yesterday
When all our dreams were swept away
I'd never crossed that line
I changed across of time
I could never live this way
If only you'd forgive
We'll start again
With all my heart
All my love for you [2x][Mark & Chris: (chorus)][break][Mark & Chris:] No surrender no return
If only you believe that...[Chris & Mark: (chorus)]


Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind.
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud
Your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you...
Yes your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you...
When we are together the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart
Your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white
And may all your Christmases be white
(Your Christmases be white)


[Ben:] The sun is shining, the rain comes in 
And i don't know what to do, no... 
I don't know where i'm going or where i've been cos my mind is hooked on you. 
Words escape me and tears come down and day slowly turns to night 
And i think of all we could have been, 
I gave up the fight. [Ben:] And you don't 
([All:] you don't), 
Understand 
([All:] understand), 
Girl you make me all i am, 
But i'm starting to see, just how hard it can be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? [Ben:] You said that we'd been defeated 
But oh i am so addicted 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why 
No, i don't know why [Paul:] The days around me and years roll on 
And i still don't think it's right 
([All:] don't think it's right) 
And i have so much love to give, 
But i gave up the fight. [Paul:] Now you don't 
([All:] you don't), 
Understand 
([All:] understand), 
Girl you made me all i am, 
Now i've started to see, just how hard it could be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? [Ben:] You said that we'd been defeated, 
But oh i am so addicted, 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true, 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why. [Paul:] No i can't make it alone 
([Ben:] i don't know why) 
And i can't be here without you in my life 
And so i ask you, why, you still deny? [Ben:] And you don't, 
Understand, 
Girl you made me all i am 
But i'm starting to see, just how hard it can be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? [All:] You said that we'd been defeated, 
But oh i am so addicted, 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true, 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why. [Ben:] No, i don't know why, 
Just tell me why, 
Please tell me why.

[ACAPELLA:]
Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know
Let me know[VERSE 1:]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You want to keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see[CHORUS:]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know. . .[VERSE 2:]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
what I say I'm all about, all about[CHORUS][BRIDGE:]
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own)
Try and find another place for me
Cause. . .[CHORUS]
Ah, ah, ah - ha
See stay at your best baby


No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do 
No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do
Liyah you're the only one for me,[3x]
the one for me, the one for me[chorus]
No one knows how to love me quite like you do... [4x][Verse 1]
When it comes down to the things I like
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
You pick me up when I'm down, you put my feet on solid ground
And you make me your first priority[Bridge]
(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
(Cause I like it) cause I like it, babe
Don't stop cause no one knows...[chorus][Verse 2]
When there are clouds on a rainy day
You know how to bring sunshine to my life
And I've never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm your goddess[Bridge][chorus][rap]
Well it's the L-I-Y-A-H plus the second chapter
R Kelly's spitin' tracks, as if it were tobacco
It's the ninties, time to get the pockets phat
So when I say "book", you say "read that"
Now back to the matter of the song
No one knows how to love me like you do
I got words for you...
Uh! Forever my man!!![chorus]
Liyah you're the only one for me, [3x]
the one for me, the one for me [till fade...]


[Chorus:]
I'm so into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you[Verse 1]
Baby can't you see I got a thing for you
I really like the way you do the things you do
Take control of me fullfill my fantasies
Here's my pager number won't you get with me[Bridge]
It's just the little things you do that turns me on
You really turn me on
And you got it goin' on I'm into you[Chorus][verse 2]
My dear I feel so weak you knock me off my feet
And it's good to know you love me just for me
I'll be here all the time I'll never let you go
There is something that I have to let you know[bridge][chorus][rap]
Well can't you see Aaliyah's got a thing for you
And the second chapter like the things you do
So pull up to my bumper and I'll ride wit' you
And let's go rollin' down a block or two
Now add a little bass to the E Q button
Now all of a sudden I gotta whisper sweet little nothing
Aaliyah told me to tell you to call her
(I'm so into you)[chorus till fade...]
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na!!!


Street Thing 
Street Thing
You and me got a street thing going on[Verse 1]
Now that we have come to know each other
I'll never go away, love will always stay here forever...
Cause this thing we've got is very rare, yeah
So don't ever go nowhere, no[chorus]
Cause you and me got
A street kinda thing goin' on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't goin' nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever[Verse 2]
You'll never have to ask a second time
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me
So there's no doubt in my mind, no
Boy this love we have is o so real, oh yes it is
That's why I'm never goin' nowhere, no[chorus]
Yo Liyah, why don't you take it to the bridge
and let 'em know how you really feel[bridge]
You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be[repeat till fade...]


[chorus:]
Young nation under a groove
Keeping it smooth with a jazz attitude
Young nation under a groove keeping it smooth
Young nation under a groove
Keeping it smooth with a jazz attitude
Young nation under a groove keeping it smooth
As I'm strollin' down the park with really nothing on my mind
Laid back and I'm just thinkin' of old times
Pumpin' our Isley Brothers tape when I'm waxin'
Peepin' through my sideview checkin' out my waxin'
Hey! I gotta say today's a good day for me to lap around the way
Ho! Time to hit the six-four
And pump the bass and I'm Just a little known
Aaliyah's in the house so I think you'd better check my flow
Hello! Hello!
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the one the two and to the three-ee-ee[chorus]
I check my celular because my beepers beepin'
Booty calls are creepin'
Fellas on the corner beepin' me (Wassup, wassup)
Don't set it off
So I pick up my girls and hit the streets just because...
Jazz-aray, it's Saturday and...
The sun is blazin', and it's so amazin'
And if you are a YNP and you're rollin' with the PGP, congratulations
I know I got the skills to make you trip
R Kelly's flippin' tracks so grab a hold and don't you sit
The nigga diggin nation that's a sooner gets my grip
So raise your hands if you're sure...
Are you a young nation?[chorus]
Well, six o' clock, girls are round and now I'm steppin'
Stop to get some dressin', to the mall I'm flexin'
You know to get them funky croaka-sacks
Tonight I'm hittin' the town, ain't holding nothing back
Hey!, Well alright tonight is the night
Well I'm in the mood for celebration, or even some jazzy conversation
Hey! It's O.K here I come so anyway
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the one the two and to the three-ee-ee[chorus 2x]
Hey! It's a great day, the lover on the way, Young Nation...

Tryin' to figure out how I could make my own records
Workin' in restaurants, bustin' on dishes
Hopin' that the man upstairs respect my wishes
Cigerette lighters, Ardig wallets, I was sellin' them
'Till I met the B H and bust down a capella to him
He said you got talent and you're goin' places
I'd heard that line before but what the heck I signed the papers
Ever since that day I drew my head high it was on
And now I'm mixing new music with the old school songs
R. Kelly play me something from the old school
R. Kelly play me something from the old school
R. Kelly play me something from the old school

If your girl only knew That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew That you was dissin' her to talk to me
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew That I would want to kick it with you (if she knew)
And if your girl could only see How you be calling me, getting fresh with me
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone

[Tann]:
Baby girl you got the whole world screaming
Giving it up for you
You got the party people fiending
Bump it to the roof
From the left side to the right side
And straight to the back
Ain't nothing going on here but a dirty money track
Got the party people waving their hands and doing the rodeo
Aaliyah, why don't you kick it, kick the flow[Aaliyah][1] -I came to give my love
To the fans across the world
Reach out to you
Touch the hearts of boys and girls[Repeat 1 (3x)]
Came to spread my love
Do do do


[Verse - 1]
Did you sleep on the wrong side? 
I'm catching a bad vibe 
And it's contagious, What's the latest? 
Speak your heart, Don't bite your tongue 
Don't get it twisted, Don't misuse it 
What's your problem? 
Lets resolve it 
We can solve it, What's the causes? 
It's official, You got issues 
I got issues, but I know I miss you [Chorus - 1]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. [Verse - 2]
I want to know: Where were you last night? 
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out 
I want to know: Were your fingers broke? 
If you had let me know, I wouldn't have put on my clothes   
I want to know: Where'd you go instead? 
Cause it was 4 in the morning, When you crept back in the bed 
I want to know: What was in your head? 
Or what was in my head? Am I supposed to change? [Chorus - 2]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? And will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? and who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. [Bridge - Aaliyah]
Baby let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) [Rap - Timbaland]
Girl holla!! 
You give me bits and pieces 
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason 
I think it's just the season, Maybe the month, Maybe the building 
Now tell me what's the reason? Snoop video? Looks are deceiving 
So, cut the crying, Cut the coughing, Cut the weazing, Girl 
Quit the blaming, Cut the naming, Cut the sleeping, Girl 
I think you need some prayer, Better call the deacon, Girl 
So, get your act right or else we won't be speaking, Girl 
So, what's it gonna be? Freaky, freaky... Me and you? 
Or is it gonna be who blames who? 
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars 
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow


I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Kill All That Loose Rap
How Many Times I Tell You "Don't Come To Me."?
You Bring Me All Of That Jealousy 
Cause You Got Envy (Don't Hate Me Baby)

So Many Times You Guys Would Come Step To Me
I Guess You Call Yourself Booking Me
But Do I Look Easy? (It Ain't Easy)
Well, It Never Hurts To Try
I Just Might Let You Call Me
I Hope You Don't Plan On Buggin' Me
That Would Be Ugly
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Kill All The Loose Rap
You Can Quit That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Stop All Your Loose Rap, Your Loose Rap
So Many Times I Hear Trying To Knock My Crew
Well, We've Got Something For All The Fools
It Ain't Just Rhythm And Blues
If You Just Quit Trying To Compete (Yeah)
No Telling What You Could Be
Might Even Be Doper Than Me, I Doubt It
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That

I Gave It All To You
With No Questions Asked
I Wanted A Future
Who Cares About My Past?
That First Argument
You Up And Left
I've Seen A Change In You
Words I Won't Accept
I Thought I Lost You
When You Twist Back My Arm
Cause The Man I Thought I Knew
Wouldn't Do Me No Harm
And That Ran Through My Mind, Over Again
I Promised Myself You Wouldn't Put Your Hands On Me Again
Never No More
I Didn't Sleep That Night
I Held My Pillow Tight
Now Trust Me When I Say
You Have Been Told
I'm Telling You Never To Touch Me No More
Never No More
I Should've Left You
When You Called Me Out My Name
I Stooped To Your Level
Replied You The Same
Now Here We Are Again
You At My Throat
Now I See The Same Old Change
That I Did Before
I Walk Away From You
At The Drop Of A Dime
So Often This Treatment
Is Way Out Of Line
And That Ran Through My Mind, Over And Over Again
Promised Myself You Won't Put Your Hand On Me Again
Never No More
You Know I Rather Give You Your Space
Cause I Just Don't Know 
Whot To or not To Say
Stay Out Your Way, Or Get In Your Face
I Just Know You Better Not Touch Me Again
Or I'll Walk Away 
That Is One Game I Refuse To Play
I Didn't Sleep That Night
I Held My Pillow Tight
Now Trust Me When I Say
You Have Been Told
I'm Telling You Never To Touch Me No More
Never No More

Late afternoon, the sun's going down
I ca-ca-call on your cell (why's he in such a hurry)
Leaving the room, he's mumbling, too
Asking for his shoes, (just leaving outt he blue)
No explanation, no actual location
Just watching him pacing (wonder who he's stressing)
Little conversation, leavin' no debation, he left the door swingin'
You better open your mi-in-ind
To read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines
9 in the morning, up, up, up way before breakfast
Homeboy gettin restless
(the room is full of questions)
Little replyin, whole lot of denyin'
You're steady collidin
(so why do he keep on trying)
I s-search for the median, now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason
(he's changing like the seasons)
Are you still pleasing, well soon you'll be leaving
Which one will be grieving?
You better open your mind
To gotta read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines
Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told
Look in his eyes, yougotta read between the lines
Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told
Look in his eyes, yougotta read between the lines
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause I, I know what's going on
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
Cause that, that ain't what I'm on
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause you'll look up, and I'll be gone
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
'cause I read between the lines
Who got you thinkin' you ishh ain't been stinkin'?
My temperatures peakin'
(why are you barely speakin)
I'm bustin' his bubble, and he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles
(i'm listening but hardly believing)
Changing the story, or trying to ignore me
Still reaching out for me
(but still I'm hardly reaching)
Give me a reason to put you back on line
You've wasted enough time
I had to open my mind
To read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old

Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines

oh oh.....
Gave you chances on top of chances
Opportunities taken for granted
My reality is all your exshalities
Cause insanity 
Why you askin'me?
Took my kindness for a sign of weakness
My own blindness cause my sadness
No longer am a slave over your madness
I am glad it's finally over
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me
Is forget you knew my name
See your qualities are less than pleasing
I got more than one reason for leaving
It's time to close shop, open new chapters
See new beginnings is what I'm after
Get your skeletons up out my closet
Don't make me lose it, I just might lose it
Who do you think you are now? (Yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Can't believe)
Who do you think you are now? (Yeah yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah babe)

I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah yeah yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you need to do is forget you knew my name
I'm a play ya to you've left
Cause you talkin' me to death
See I ain't even sad that I'm here all by myself
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah yeah)
Who do you think you are now?

This Is Where I've Got To Draw The Line
Cause I Refuse To Let You Think You Can Play With My Mind
Always Seems That You Think That I'm Blind
Causes There Always Certain Times When Your Hard To Find
Your On The Go, I'm On The Go, Were On The Go
I Can't Catch You No More, Can't See You No More
And It No Longer Can Be Ignored
Cause At Once Upon A Time It Was You I Adored
You Disappeared And Left Me Here, Out In The Cold 
And The Absence Of You Is Hurting My Soul
Didn't Know There Was An End Of The Road
It Was So Easy For You Just To Let It All Go
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door
And I Refuse
No way i cant it baby
And I Refuse
No way i cant it baby
And I Refuse
No Way , But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore
Remember When I Told You I Could Feel The Change
You Don't Touch Me The Same, Don't Hold Me The Same
No, I Don't Want You To Take All The Blame
Cause I Know I Had Those Moments When I Caused The Pain
This Back And Forth Just Like A War With You And Me
See We Both Disagree, Have We Ever Agreed?
This Is Nothing Like I Thought It Would Be
Was It All Just A Dream? Was It Ever In My Reach?
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door
It Was Your Way
Or It Was No Way
And I Couldn't Live That Way
It Was Our Call
Then It Was Your Call
Cause I Gave You My All And All
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door
No way i cant it baby
No way i cant it baby
No Way, But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore
No way i cant it baby
No way i cant it baby
No Way, But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore
I Refuse (I Refuse)
I Refuse (I Refuse)
And I Refuse (Ooooh)
And I Refuse (I Refuse)
I Refuse (Said I Refuse)
And I Refuse
Said I Refuse To Take It Anymore

Ohhhh no... ohh, oh... mmmm
Oh... ohhhh...
Maybe I'm just wrong for feelin the way I do
Thoughts indecent, want to put those down to you
I know you have a girl, I don't want to tie
When you're free one night just make those hours mine
I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright
Love just ain't my thang, but half of you might be
Enough for two or more, no her to me and me
Fine like expensive wine, drunk off one glass of you
I think more might be too much, so weekends for me are cool
I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright
I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright....[repeat until end]


We Ain't Lovers No More
We Don't Laugh No More
We Don't Play No More
We Don't Make-Up No More
We Don't Kiss No More
We Don't Hug No More
You Don't Please Me No More
You Don't Touch No More
Give Me Chills No More
We Don't Go Out No More
We Don't Kick It No More
We Don't Dance No More
I Remember 
Walking Through The Park
Just Shooting The Breeze
Kissing In The Shade
Those Were The Days
Lounging In The Den
Breakfast In the Bed
You Let Me Have My Way
Those Were The Days
If You Don't Want Me No More
Don't Come Round No More
Just Don't Call No More
Don't Come Knockin' Up At My Door
After Ten Or So
What You Knockin' For?
We Don't Kick It No More
You Ain't Cute No More
You Ain't Fly No More
You Ain't Got It Like That No More
See In Your Clothes You Don't
I Still Remember
Walking Through The Park
Just Shooting The Breeze
Kissing In The Shade
Those Were The Days
Lounging In The Den
Breakfast In the Bed
You Let Me Have My Way
Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
I Said Those Were The Days
I Said Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
What's Up With This Baby?
You Done Changed On Me (You Done Changed)
This Ain't The Way It Used To Be, Baby
You Don't Know Me No More 
You Can't Lie No More
Ain't Gon' Try No More
Won't Have To Say Goodbye No More
You Gotta Hit The Road
Hate To See You Go
I Ain't The One To Mess With No Flow
Don't Take Pictures No More
Don't Hold Hands No More
This Is The End Of The Road
But I Still Remember
Walking Through The Park
Just Shooting The Breeze
Kissing In The Shade
Those Were The Days
Lounging In The Den
Breakfast In the Bed
You Let Me Have My Way
Those Were The Days


What if.. every guy I saw

What if.. what would you say
What if.. what if, what if, what if
I hate a jealous man, one who doesn't understand
That I'm attractive so of course men wanna take my hand
And lead me off round the corner maybe to their place
But when they speak you get mad, jumping all up in my face
But on the other hand when women come and speak to you
You kiss and hug them like it's something that you let me do
You're only jealous cause you know the ish you put me through
I might turn right around and do that ish right back to you
What if.. every guy I saw

If you gonna cheat burn the receipt from the hotel room
But instead you're up in my face saying you were at friends
But they all call asking me where the hell you been
Why they keep treating us this way
I guess it's a little game we play
We'll burn you (oh), we'll cut you (oh)
We'll kill you (oh)
We don't have to take it no more

What would you do
To get to me
What would you say
To have your way
Would you give up
Or try again
If I hesitate
To let you win
Or would you be yourself
Or play your role
Tell all the boys
Or keep it low
If I say no
Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you stay[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again
I'm into you,
You into me
But I cant let it go
So easily
Not 'til I see
What this could be
Be eternity
Or just a week
You know, our chemistry
Is off the chain
Is perfect now
But will it change
This aint a yes
This aint a no
Just do your thang
We'll see how it goes...ohhh
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try it again
You can dust it off and try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try it again
Dust yourself off and try again[Hook]
If you dont wanna throw it all away
Might be shy on the first date
What about the next date
huh, huh, huh, huh
If you dont wanna throw it all away
You might be buggin' on the first date
But what about the next date
um, um, um, um


[x2:]
I
I wanna love ya[Verse 1:]
Baby ever since I found you,
Seems like everyday I've been happy,
See the way you love me,
Turns me out, baby I can feel my heart beat,
Seems like lately I've been thinkin',
Feelin' that you are everything,
Feels like more and more,
I'm hoping that you are the only.[Chorus:]
All I need,
All I need,
All I need is you.
Baby you're everything,
Everything,
Everything is you.
Baby you're all I need,
All I need,
All I need is you.
Baby you're everything,
Everything,
Everything is you.[Verse 2:]
Baby usually when you do me,
Keepin' me straight,
Show me all your lovin',
Baby you're so amazing,
Never dreamed I'd be cravin' 2 be open,
Never thought it was a joke and
Didn't know I would realize real love,
And I'd been hopin',
That'd you,
Stay right here with me,
Give me all, give me all,
All the love I need,
Baby you're all, all I need.[Chorus]
I don't want nobody but you,
I don't need nobody but you,
Said I don't want nobody but you,
'Cause I don't love nobody but you.[x4:]
I
I wanna love ya[Chorus]


[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
(Said I need you)
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you[Verse 1]
Off to college
Yes, you went away
Straight from high school
You up and left me
We were close friends
Also lovers
Did everything
For one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back...to me
Can you...feel me (Callin')
Hear me...callin' (For you)
For you...'Cause it's[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you[Verse 2]
Now I'm sittin' here
Thinkin' 'bout you
And the days we used to share
It's drivin' me crazy
I don't know what to do
I'm just wonderin' if you still care
I don't wanna let you know
That it's killin' me
I know you got another life you gotta concentrate baby
Come back...to me
Can you...feel me (Callin')
Hear me...callin' (For you)
For you...'Cause it's[Chorus 2x]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you[Bridge]
I...can't...be...no...more
Since you went away I
Don't really feel like talkin'
No one here to love me
Baby do you understand me
I can't do or be without you[Chorus 3x]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
(Tell me what I'm gonna do)
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you


There’s no need for you,
Baby,
It ain’t what you think,
So don’t worry,[Verse 1]
You remember back in the day when,
We thought it was special,
When we always stayed down,
No matter where we went you’d stay in touch,
Two people that were just so in love,
Now you claiming that you feelin’ like things
Ain’t really been the way they used to be,
And you say it seems like I changed,
But I’m still the same.[Chorus (2X)]
There’s no need for you,
(To worry ‘bout me)
Baby,
(Don’t worry ‘bout me)
It ain’t what you think,
(You still got me)
So don’t worry,
(Don’t worry ‘bout, don’t worry ‘bout me)
Even though it seems,
(You’re losing me)
And things,
(Ain’t what they used to be)
Baby,
(I ain’t gonna leave)
Don’t worry,
(Don’t worry ‘bout, don’t worry ‘bout me)[Verse 2]
I was headin’ out to Cali,
For a show,
I told you that on Tuesday,
I’d be home,
Left a message on your voicemail
Sayin’ I’d call you later,
To inform you I’m alright,
Now you callin’,
Just to tell me that you heard,
I was seen in a Bentley with my girls,
So I’m on my way to a spot where people hang,
But nothing’s changed.[Chorus (2X)][Bridge]
There’s no need to
Worry ‘bout what
I do when I’m away.
(Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thing)
Don’t worry ‘bout what I do when I'm outta town,
(Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thing)
Don’t worry ‘bout how I do when I put it down,
(Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thing)
Trust in my everything’s gonna be alright,
Gonna work it out, be home tonight.[Chorus (2X)]

[ACAPELLA:]
Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know
Let me know[VERSE 1:]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You want to keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see[CHORUS:]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know. . .[VERSE 2:]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
what I say I'm all about, all about[CHORUS][BRIDGE:]
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own)
Try and find another place for me
Cause. . .[CHORUS]
Ah, ah, ah - ha
See stay at your best baby

Went from my nigga serving it by the tele
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli
The fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassin'
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became somethin'
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This the shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Can't you talk to me
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby
Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about[Chorus:]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

Came too far to give up
Gotta try, cause I can't do it on my own
Can't you talk to me
Tell me what you need
Can't you talk to me
Tell me what you need


Mhmm
Ohh, ohh
Yeah
Giving up, mm, is hard to do
When you really love someone
Giving up, so hard to do
When you still depend upon, his warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
Ooh, they used to mean so much, mm
And bring you happiness, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Giving up, so hard to do
I've tried, but it just ain't no use
Giving up, so hard to do
I said I've tried, but it just ain't no use
But my light of hope is burning dim
Oh but, mhmm, but in my heart I pray
That my love and faith in the man
Will ohh, will bring him back to me
Aye hey, aye hey
I'm talking 'bout if you really love somebody, heyy
Ooh, ooh, whether 
Whether he knows or not, hmm
He, he, he really needs me too
I said the man is all I got, oh, yes he is, yeah
And giving up, giving up is so hard to do
Oh, oh, oh, giving up, heyy
So hard to do, heyy, heyy, giving up
So hard for me to do
I said I've tried it, hey
Can't break through

Cause you mean so much to me, heyy
Ooh, giving up


Yeahhh.... Mmmm-hmm..... Whoaaaa.... Oooh yea...[1]
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone[2]
When we hooked up we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never ever leave us
That was a while ago
But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like all we do is fight
Every single night 
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back, take it way back
All the way back, can we start again
Do it over, can we straighten it out
Can we work it out, cuz...
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone[3]
I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you, be without you
I can't even breathe without you...
I can't feel with out you, deal without you, spend without you
My whole world is upside down...
Don't wanna go out cuz I can't ride without you
Feelin like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
Said I can't live...
Live without you, live without you
I can't go...
Go without you, go without you
Said I don't wanna be alone
Said I can't be... 
Be without you, be without you
Said I can't live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
Said I don't wanna be alone
How can this be (that it's not workin out)
That it's not workin out
We vowed to be always together
It's hurting me that we don't talk no more
It's not supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong
We both made mistakes, but gotta carry on
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna live, no.... No.....

Heart, don't fail me now!
Courage, don't desert me!
Don't turnback
Now that we're here
People always say
Life is full of choices
No one ever mentions fear!
Or how a road can seem so long
How the world can seem so vast
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey...to the past
Somewhere down this road
I know someone's waitingg
Years of dreams
Just can't be wrong
Arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
Fin'lly home where I belong
Well, starting here, my life begins
Starting now, I'm learning fast
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey...to the past
Heart don't fail me now!
Courage don't desert me!
Home, Love, Family
There was once a time
I must have had them too
Home, Love, Family
I will never be complete
Until I find you...
One step at a time
One hope, then another
Who knows where
This road may go-
Back to who i was
On to find my future
Things my heartstill
Needs to know
Yes, let this be a sign!
Let, this road be mine!
Let it lead me to my past
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
To bring me home...
At last!
At Last!

Now he's dissing me cause he dissed you 
Can you believe the nerve of this dude? 
Cause of your memory I won't bring in the pistols 
But he got issues enough of that lame 
I never seen pain like your parents pain 
But I know God protecting you 
You used to read Seed Of The soul I know God perfecting you 
All the estrogen the darker texture you are the more intellectual

We feel your presence just not in the physical 
All across the world, blocks is miserable 
Y'all left a void it's alot of little yous 
But they not original and they not identical 
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews 
That's when hip hop if it's not ten of you 
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws 
Footprints on the game hood ain't been the same 
Feeling ain't been in music hooks ain't been the same 
But I'm doing what I can man and try to follow y'all memory lane man 
Big you be ashamed to see New York gangbang 
Pac you feel the same thing they use your name in vein 
But I guess that's the issue 
And it proves how much, niggas really miss you [Outro: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
Pun we missing you Big L we missing you

Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you)

Soldiers and soldgettes all across the world (I miss you) 
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all live in our memories forever

Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you 
Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you


It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
No days go by I'm thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do[repeat]
You're on my mind all day and night
You're all I'm thinking of the way you treat me right
My days with you are here no more
We had some good days I know for sure[chorus]
No days go by I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget( I can't get you off my mind)
The thing you do[repeats]
We've got a special thing I never could explain
Straight up the way I feel it doesn't seem real
I never meant to hurt you don't go nowhere
Cause you know this heart I'll always share
You said your love was true but I don't see that
You left me alone broke up this happy home
Why'd you have lie
No days go by I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget ( you are always on my mind)
The thing you do
My love
And on and on and on


[Verse 1]
Hey there, you nasty boy, it’s been a minute
And I could say my life has changed since you hit it
This is your strongest trait, you worked a miracle
While they say I’m sprung, I say "Baby, you did it"[Hook]
They say you a baller, I hear you’re just a player
And all my friends tell me I should have never dated
But now I’m in love with you and I’mma have to tell ‘em
Quit hatin’ on him, don’t be jealous[Bridge]
(Your world, your world)
I’m into you boy, it can be
(Your world, your world)
Boy this don’t mean that I gotta be
(Your girl, your girl)
Had to take my friend home
My girls, nowhere without my girls, baby[Verse 2]
Hey, first I seen you in a Beamer, and then I saw the Lexus
I knew about the Benzes, with the 20-inch rims on ‘em
And a lot of ex-girlfriends, I bet they still calling
Well I can’t say I blame ‘em, cause you have something[Hook][Bridge][Bridge][Hook]


Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
A special smile, a certain touch
I never had a love that I loved so much
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there
My very best friend, my summer day
My only someone to depend on
When I've lost my way
You came and answered my every prayer
Turn the page, you were there
What would I do if some strange morning
I opened up my eyes to find you gone
I can't imagine how I would survive it
I finally got the reason to go on
My one sure thing, my solid ground
All I ever wanted was the love that we found
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there, yeah
What would I do if strange morning
I opened up my eyes to find you gone
I can't imagine how I would survive it
I can't imagine how I would go on
A special smile, a certain touch
I never had a love that I loved so much
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there
You came and answered my every prayer
Turn the page, you were there
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, ooh


[Intro - Missy Elliott]
I've been around the world (mmmmm)
And I still can't find my baby
See I searched high and low
And I still...still can't find my baby[Verse 1 - Aaliyah]
(Ashame) It's ashame (shame, shame)
That I've searched the sky, high and low
Still can't find my baby..
Where could he (where could he be at?)
Where, could he be? (where could he be?)
Let me walk the streets
Through snow and sleet
Until I find my baby, baby[Chorus:]
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye
Is he seein another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die?
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi[Verse 2:]
(Oh) It's a crime (crime, crime)
When you take this poor heart of mine
Use it for a rug to walk on (a rug to walk on)
Then you're gone (gone)
Then right out my life for the last time
I'm gonna find my baby, baby[Chorus:]
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi (ay-yi-yi)
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye (he didn't say goodbye)
Is he seein another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die? (until I die-die-die-die)
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi[Hook:]
Why can't
You call me?
Dial me
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Why can't
You call me?
Dial me
Yeah-yeah[Chorus (repeat 2x)]
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye
Is he with another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die?
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi[Outro (Tweet):]
I keep searchin' and searchin'!

[Verse 1:]
I'm a lady that comes with no chances
That means if I spot a sign of trouble your gone
To many times before, seemed I always played the fool
How was I to know, I was young and Gullible
I let the guys play my heart as if it was a toy
I got respect for me, now is a new day[Pre-chorus:]
I'm gonna let you play the games on me
Because I got a better strategy
And if you ever cause depression whoa,
Then you'sa gotta go, go, go[Chorus:]
I'ma fight the tears so my make-up, don't mess up
And I'ma fight the feelings I be wantin to call you
And I'ma fight you back, if you ever step to me,
Closin up the doors
Made it clear before, 
Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)[Verse 2:]
Don't get me wrong I don't hate men,
I love 'em, but I just think that some should stop their problems
Some are confusers, users, abusers, 
Some are just plain 'ol losers
Boy your silly games won't get away with me
I'm not the foolish girly that I used to be
Chuck it out the window, just like that
If your head is 'posed to be where it's at

Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)[Bridge:]

Theres fishes in the sea

Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My man has found another, and gone away
With him went my future, my life is filled with gloom,
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange,
But I wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause so badly
I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)
but I cant go no I can't let him see me cryin'
But listen, I got to cry, cuz crying, ooooooooh,
Is the pain, oh yeah
you know people, this hurt I feel inside,
Words, they, could never explain,
I wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooooooh baby
Let it rain (rain, rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain
Day in and day out, my tears stained face
Pressed against my window pane
My eye search the skies, well, desperately for rain
Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops and no one will ever know
That I'm crying (crying) crying (crying)
When I go outside
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain,
I just wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooooh baby
Let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Yeah, You know I'm a man, I ain't got no pride,
Til it rains, I'm gonna stay inside,
Let it rain, Let it rain
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh how I wish that it would rain...


If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me, yeah
You know I tried to treat you right
But, you stay out, stay out every night
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin
Bring it on home to me.
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Baby, bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
I'll give you lovin and money too
That ain't all, all I do for you,
Baby if you bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, oh honey
You know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me.
But I forgive you, yeah


Looking out on the morning rain 
I used to feel uninspired 
And when I knew I had to face another day 
Lord, it made me feel so tired 
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind 
But your love was the key to peace my mind 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman 
When my soul was in the lost-and-found 
You came along to claim it 
I didn't know just what was wrong with me 
Till your kiss helped me name it 
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for 
Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman 
Oh, baby, what you've done to me 
You make me feel so good inside 
And I just want to be close to you 
You make me fell so alive 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman


Like the treble and the reverb
We go good together babe
Treble and the reverb oh
We go good together babe
Treble and the reverb oh oh oh
We go good together babe
Treble and the reverb oh
We go good together baby


[Verse 1:]
Empty pizza boxes on the floor
Empty liquor bottles from before
You'll find your comfort in between the sheets
Way to afraid to take it to the streets
Confidence just went out the window
So down can't get up can't move no more
Life is passing by and your poor soul is gone ooh[Chorus: x2]
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up
Get Up
(Get Up)
Get out of bed.
Stop wasting time[Verse 2:]
Say that you'll do it the next day
Then in rolls the year 2008
Still procrastinating
Your work is overdue
Say that you'll buy a big house
But you ain't got sh! t right now
Disappointed cause you said that change was gonna
COME
COME
COME
OOOOOH[Chorus: x2]
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up
Get Up

Tell me if you hear me
Tell me if you're listening oh
If you understand say...[Chorus: x2]

You think you sleep
Staying out at night
But you know damn right you is wrong
You’re running all over town
While your man waits around
At home thinking that you’re with your girl
But he don’t know
That you out here, making him look like a fool no
No, no he don’t know
That you out here doing him dirty
He don’t know
Another man is giving his lady love
He don’t know
Cause if he did he’d kick you out that door
You said Bob’s your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know you’re somebody’s wife
Now what makes you think
That the birdies won’t sing?
About all of them secrets you hold
You ho-old
Whatever goes up
Must come back down
Shit like this always hits the ground
But he don’t know
That you out here, making him look like a fool no
No, no he don’t know
That you out here doing him dirty
He don’t know
Another man is giving his lady love
He don’t know
Cause if he did he’d kick you out that door
You said Bob’s your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know you’re somebody’s wife
So we’re talking

Remember the days when we used to chill
We didn't have a care in the world
We used to laugh together
Blaze it up and walk 'round the creek
Reminiscing on the time
When we used to skip class together
I could never forget ooooh
Never forget my good friends
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back to the day when we used to play
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back to the day when we used to play
He-e-ey. Oooh.
Take me back, take me back oh yeah
Yeah Oh!
Summertime, weather was hot as hell
I swear it ain't hot like it used to be
Back then the music was fire
Why did I had to go leave and retire?
Reminiscing on the time
When things were much better way back then
I could never forget uh
Never forget the time spent oh oh
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Just for a moment, a moment back in time
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me
Can we go back? I wanna go back
When we were so young and our hearts would run free
Can we go back? I wanna go back
I heard it's foolish to say
That things were better back in the day
But I swear it ain't the same
You know that I gotta roll with the change
But can we go back?
Just one time
You and I
Can we go back?
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back just one time
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Can we?
Can we go back? I wanna go back
When we were so young oh oh oh
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Can weeeee?
Woaahhhhhhhh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


If you ask me
What our love’s all about
I would say our love is like a flower
With the petals pulled out
No one to try to put us down baby
Because I love you too much and 
You love me too but
There’s just some problems that we gotta work through time
There’s not much time
We gotta get it together today
Because tomorrow man, you never know
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
Bittersweet memories
Of how we used to be
I know right now we’re still together
But the fire and passion is gone
It’s killing me
Every day
Because our love ain’t the same
And every night I pray please God don’t take my baby away
Oh time
There’s not much time
We gotta get it together today
Because tomorrow man, you never know
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
You used to hold me real close
And I didn’t let go of you, just held on tight
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away
You used to hold me real close
And I didn’t let go of you, just held on tight
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away
Fire burning love


These days, the back of my mind
Lately I’ve been thinking
About the thing that you di back then
‘Bout all them girls, now you mess with them
Know I forgave you but I can’t forget
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
Back of my mind
Whenever I look up in the sky I’m like
Count the stars
It amounts to all the teardrops from my eyes
Oh yes it does
And it hurts 
Cause I love you
And this shit just won’t go away
It’s in my head
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
Back of my mind
I tried to forget it
I tried
But it just won’t leave me alone
I wanna move on
But it just stays, stays in the back of my mind
Oh it stays, stays in the back of my mi-mi-mi-mi-mind


Hey Mr. Heartbreaker
Do me a favor
Stop making me cry
Cause I feel I ain't strong no more
I need you to stop right now
Cause it feels like I'm sinking down
With my pockets full of stones
And a brick tied around my soul
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Hey Mr. Heartbreaker
You know I used to be a fighter
But ever since you came into my life
I can't find what's wrong from right
Oh you took the hope out of me
I can't find any joy in anything
And all of the things that I used to enjoy
I don't enjoy them no more
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Everybody's wondering
Where she go
The girl that they used to know
She don't live here no more
She's gone
She's gone
She's gone
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the same


And I'm guessing you still think I still got them
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
Like a coin to a packer with a hole
We were like them, nothing less, nothing more
Here's your 50 cent, fine! You can keep it
Cause you are a little late and your pockets is empty
You used to be my wind and I was your dust
I'll follow you everywhere you could thrust
The end of the day comes night
Now I know wrong from right
I remember the night you was walking
Hand in hand with that flimsy girl
And you made sure I'd end up feeling like it's my fault
It took some time to open up my eyes
Now the grass is surely greener on the other side
I'm glad that I can say, I got this fool out my mind
And I'm guessing you still think I still got them
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
I need a boy, lookin lookin at my phone
Hopping, praying you could call it
It got too quiet so ended up falling falling falling
Sunken down, sunken down
An di was here to 11, and now you're expecting
For me to come around cause what we had was profound
You don't miss your water until it runs dry
Never like before, you had me wrong with your lies
And I'm guessing you still think I still got that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
To be honest I was a little clueless
Didn't know that you'd end up being so heartless
I was mess when you left
After all the stress babe, they should put you under arrest
Now you're over here thinking you could get it back
Look at you, still thinking you want that
I tell you what... you can kiss my ass


She’s ambitious
Man, and she’s vicious
Really beautiful
I never thought in my life I would never do it again
But now I do
She had a mission
She had a vision
To be with my man
I could swear that I could see the twinkle in her eyes
She had a plan
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other way
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
He’s so faithful
I’m so grateful he belongs to me
She’s tried so many times
But in the end she always finds it
Hard, too much all over me
I’m losing patience
She will be facing
Me very soon
If she don’t stop
Somebody better call the cops 
Cause I’ll go swinging
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other way
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
She’s the one playing with her hair
Walking ‘round like she don’t care
She’s the one that sprinkles all the trouble in the air
She’s the type that likes to mess around with other ladies’ guys
That’s Miss Lovely
She’s Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other way
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Look the other way
I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Look the other way
I’ll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile
I’ll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile
I’ll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile into a frown
Miss Lovely


The man at the door, 6 foot 4
Just told me that I can’t get in
He said that it was closing
But he was only lying
‘Cause it was only open for his friends
I came to have a good time
Wanted to spin my edge, Yes I did
But had me feeling like I wasn’t good enough to come in
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
The girl with the smoky eyes dipped in the skewer reminiscing over mocking birds
She’s a birdie that likes to mock and just talks talks talks
That messed up
Oh, she doesn’t gets it
Because she thinks she perfect
And everyone to rock will think she’s right
Well let me tell you something
That karma is a bitch
And when it comes to rock 
You’re gonna feel that chick
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
The cast outs, the bullied arounds
The ones that got chased out of town
The cats that always got put down
The longer they’re away, they come back around
I promise you’re gonna see your better days
I promise it won’t always be this way
So let them fools believe that they could
Cause one day they’re gonna walk in your shoes
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang


I sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
Why you complainin?
What's it to you?
You ain't even been through the things that I've been through
You don't know me,
Hell, I don't know you
Stop tryna tell me what I should and shouldn't do
You got your own lives
Stop focusing on mine
I can do what the hell I like
Baby don't waste your time
Sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
They say she was pregnant, they say she was fat
They say she was ugly, as she ain't know that
She don't suit the haircut, I think she's a try hard
I don't like the music and I think she's stupid
Damn, you people got so much to say
I wonder if you're strong enough to take my place
Sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give two shits about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
I never thought it would be that hard
Doing what I really love
All my life all I wanted to do was this nothing at all
This is my life, you can't take it
No, you bitches can't break it
None of you haters can replace it
None of you haters can take it from me
This is my life
This is my life
This is my, my, my life


Every night I sit by the window
Crying like a wolf cause your love's gone
I didn't mean it when I said that I hate you
Know that I love you
And even if you don't love me anymore
Then I'll just be here, sitting, crying tears on the floor
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying for you you you
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'm thinking to myself – who's loving you now?
The thought of another is making me break down
I didn't mean it when I said it's over
Please don't say it's over
And even if you don't love me anymore
Then I'll just be here, sitting, crying tears on the floor
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying for you you you
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Howling at the moon and I hope that you can hear my call
Come back to me
Said come back to me
That's the sound of the beat of my heart, boom boom
Hoping that you will hear my call
I'm howling at the moon, I hope you hear me baby
Hear me baby


If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Hey, woke up today
Realized that things just ain't the same
For me and you, I was confused
But now my screws ain't really that loose
After all this time, made up my mind
This relationship wasn't really that tight
You were Mr. Wrong when I needed Mr. Right
Somewhere down the line you lost that body
Cause every day is a battle when it comes to love
You gotta put up a fight
When it comes, when it comes to love
You don't just give up your trying
I've been trying for too long
To get you to hold on
But I guess you, you don't love me anymore
If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Shameless, a damn shame the things I do end up this way
Stay awake got nothing to say
Acting like you ain't really that phased
But I swear baby in time
You 'bout to find that missing piece of mine
And when you find that I'm off to the next one
I'll be singing something about my new one
Saddest thing is loving
Loving someone who
Who used to love me
Saddest feeling is knowing how
How good it used to be
I gotta let go of memories
That keep me from leaving
Cause you don't, you don't love me anymore
If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
I'm done with pretending that we're alright
I can't keep on fronting, I don't wanna lie, anymore
I'm outta door, I'm looking for a better lover
That can make my heart smile
See that's what you used to do
But now you actin like you ain't got nothing to lose
I'm a make it easy for you
I'm a be the first to say it
Darling, I think we're through
If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore


And the reverb
We go good together baby oh oh oh
We go good together babe oh oh oh
We go good together babe
Like the treble and the reverb yea
We go good together babe

I don't know what to do 
I can't believe it's true that 
You can make me feel this way 
I see it in your eyes 
It made me realize 
There's something that I've got to say 
I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry 
For all the things I've done to make you worry 
And all the time I've cared for you from the bottom of my heart 
I will be yours if you'll be mine 
I will be there till the end of time 
I will be with you until the day that I die 
I'll be yours. I'll be yours 
I've been around the world 
And have seen a lot of girls 
But n one can compare to you 
It's really plain to see 
That you belong to me 
Cause you're the only one I need.

I can tell that you've been hurt 
By that look on your face girl 
Some guy brought safety to your happy world 
You need love but you're afraid that if you give in 
Some one else will come along 
And sock it to you again 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard 
I could make you happy baby and satisfy you too 
But how can I when you won't give me a chance to prove my love to you 
Won't you give me just one little chance 
I give you my guarantee that you won't be hurt again 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard 
I've been noticing you baby for long, long time 
I'm not ashamed to tell the world that you really messed up my mind 
Girl, to me you're like a dream come true 
I would rather hurt myself then to ever hurt you 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard.

I remember the day we met 
Almost like a fairy tale 
Kinda like Romeo and Juliet 
I never gonna forget 
Now my knees went weak 
When you said "hi" 
And then you held my hand 
And look me in the eye 
I almost died, deep inside 
There's so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I never learned myself 
I wanna do what you want me to do 
I want you and no one else 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
I heard about how wonderful love can be 
But in my mind I never could have dreamed 
Such a fantasy 
Maybe it's destiny 
I share myself with you in a special way 
I'm not a little boy 
I never gonna leave you 
And I'm gonna say 
That everything is okay 
There's so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I never learned myself 
I wanna do what you want me to do 
I want you and no one else 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x] 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile.

Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Action, your body activates freedom 
Your mind excellerates passion 
The time has come to get wild 
Rise up and follow fusion 
Our youth is just an illusion 
Let's start a revolution 
Explore the corridores 
We'll find our restitution 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Music, it's all around and you choose it 
To take control or you lose it 
Your way to find an escape from dancing to this song 
Power, minutes turned into hours 
Now's the time to get louder 
The light is there to be seen you're dreamin', no you've gotta 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
We've travelled so far 
To explore the mysteries of life 
And the reality of our youth 
Is overlooked by those who restrict our freedom 
Our freedom of expression, our freedom to get wild 
This is Aaron and this is my world 
And it's yours 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Listen, they're callin' you but you're missin' 
You're standin' off in position 
A crowded room is in rage 
I'm up on stage fire 
You say you wanna go higher up and fly away you're gone, 
Ain't nothing wrong with standin', I'm commandin' you to 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild.


I'd do anything for you 
We've had our good times and bad 
Baby what is sad 
I miss you girl 
Oh yes I do 
Now that you're gone ...away 
It's hard for me to say 
I miss you girl 
Oh yes I do 
I just want you to know 
That the love I have is real 
But girl I really want to show you how I feel 
I'd do anything 
To be with you again 
Just name the place 
And I will be there, I will be there 
Oh tell me why can't I 
Have the one I love 
Just like the way it used to be 
I miss you all of the time 
When you were mine 
I miss the way it seemed so right 
How could I let the girl I love 
Slip right through my hands 
I can't get you off my mind 
I just want to make you happy 
I want to make you understand 
I need you for my girlfriend 
Until the very end 
Oh I miss holding hands and playing games 
I get chills when I hear your name 'cuz I know 
It'll never be the same 
I'd do anything 
Just to be with you 
I'll tell you that I love you 
If you want me to 
Just call my name 
And I'll be there 
To let you know how much I care 
Oh... baby...


My mama told me I'm too young to love 
But I know what I know and I can't get enough 
I'm thinking about you and me holding hands 
Pushing you on a swing 
We can do anything 
Cause when I think of you all I know 
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart 
I often wonder the meaning of love 
Is it something meant just for grown-ups? 
Nick always told me just to follow my dreams 
But with love on my mind it is so hard to see 
And still when I think of you all I know 
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart 
It's true if I'm wrong 
Then tell me girl what should I do 
Or would you even care 
If I told you love could be so simple 
Between me and you 
Oh, baby 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart.


You found out 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
You must have heard it from my best friend 
She's always talkin' when she should be listening 
Can't keep a secret to save her life 
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside 
I never knew a rumour could spread so fast 
But now the word is out all over town 
That I'm longing for you 
How did you know cause I never told 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
No more charades my heart's been displayed 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
Maybe I was the one who left a trace 
Was there a message written on my face 
Were my emotions so easily read 
That you would know my thoughts before a word was said 
Was it my eyes that let you know you had control 
Because the way you move was so self-assured 
You knew I would surrender 
How did you know cause I never told 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
No more charades my heart's been displayed 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
You found out I've got a crush on you.


Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
You stood out amongst the crowd 
And I was left without a doubt 
That you were meant for me 
So romanced was I by you 
One dance and then I knew 
That I could fall in love, oh yeah 
Oh baby won't you swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing it out, girl swing it out, girl swing it [7x]
I have never known before 
A girl I wanted more 
The way I want you now 
I admit you are the best 
And with you I am obsessed 
And could never do without 
Oh baby, won't you swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
I, I like to watch you when you dance 
(When you, watch you when you dance) 
And tonight don't you make any other plans 
Unless you're making them with me 
Swing it, swing it, swing it (2x) 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out.


..He's here..[Laughing]
What are you doin' tonight?
Man, I got this big test tomorrow that I got to study for...
EHHHH...wrong!
Your partyin' with me tonight
Party? Where?
At my house,
It's going to be the 
party of the century
everone's going to be there
How do you plan on getting your parents out of the house?[Record scratch]
Hmm..Good question...


[Talking:]
Here's a little bit of old school for ya, 
That goes a little something like this...
I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(Throw the party of the month)
No, the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
(No, send them to a show)
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though
I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...
The door bell rings cuz the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Nobody can do it like Aaron can)
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I'm guessin' where I'm goin' cuz I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said
People all around you gotta 
(Come get it) 
Everyone together sing it loud 
(Come get it) 
Jump all around, come on 
(Come get it) 
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)
People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what 
Na na na na... Na na na na...
Things are goin' great 
Then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellows, yo, ya gotta get out
(Hey man I heard this was an open house) 
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
Well I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)
Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and 
Another kid broke the lamp 
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later 
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her
People all around you gotta
(come get it) 
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it) 
Jump all around come on
(come get it) 
What?
(come get it)
Say it again here we go, uh
(come get it) 
People all around you gotta
(come get it) 
From the left to the right, make noise
(come get it) 
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what
Aaron C's in the house, here we go 
Come with it
Break it down
(go go go go go...)
Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double 
I'm dead (your done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't wanna even start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin around the house 
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test
The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left 
(AARON!!!???!!!) 
Grounded[Chorus]
Aaron C's in the house, come on 
(come get it)
Uh uh what what[Fades...]


I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
She's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
Go to see her when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer girl in town
You're my girl, what the doctor ordered
So sweet, you make my mouth water
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
Candy in the morning time,
Candy in the hot sunshine.
Candy baby can't you see,
All I want is your candy!
Candy in the morning time,
Candy in the hot sunshine.
Candy baby can't you see,
All I want is your candy!
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
All I want is your candy!
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
All I want is your candy!


I wanna see ya bounce
Welcome to the party 
This is one of a kind
Like a hot chilli pepper
It'll blow your mind
Don't know if you can take it
So now we're gonna shake it
And if you can't
getcha in house arrest
It's like this 
We've got the crazy notion
DJ's treating us with a jumpin' potion
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air
Oh yeah
Ya gotta get up
to get it down
(Come on, come on)
When the beat kicks in
and you feel the scream
Just don't stand around
Are you ready to jump
Gonna funk around
??
Let the fun begin
Don't stop now cause I wanna see ya bounce[Chorus]
Livin' it up
Cause we're here to party
With a bouncey, bouncey
Gonna make you happy
Playin' the disco bongo with me
And a bouncey, bouncey
Come dance with me[X2]
Stop the tracks
Can't you see it's not enough
Find the bliss
And he's coming on tough
They say turn it down
What'd ya say
No way
The sounds are pumpin'
From the DJ
Crank it up
Cause we're gonna ??
The original Millenium

Ain't no doubt about it
I can't wait to get home to you
(I gotta get home, yeah, uh, uh, come on.)
Connected with my baby
Just jammin online with you
(online, online, online)
Here in my room we are as one
(together you and me, together you and me)
Hours connect
As we switch on (switch on)[Chorus]
She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl)
She's my one and only
And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl)
She's my best kept secret
Hooked up all night with that girl
(my internet girl)
She's my one and only, my internet girl
(my internet girl)
My internet girl, my internet girl.
Shufflin' through my windows
Gotta find my way back to you
(I gotta find away, gotta find a way)
(I gotta find a way, gotta find a way)
You left me mail in the inbox
Thinkin' about what we should do
(I will type again girlfriend, so tell me, tell me what you wanna do)
You left me the password to your heart
(yeah, that's it. I got it.)
No lookin' back we clicked from the start
I wanna let you know
She's mine[Chorus X2. fade]


And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this 
Hit It!
Aaron's in the house
Come on
Get up get up
I wanna make it bounce
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
Aaron's in the house
Yo guys, check it out
Guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball
Working on my game
(Yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow
It was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquile O'Neal
(What? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, do you wanna play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad
Try not to cry
(Please Aaron, are you for real?)
(One-on-one with Shaquile O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 Centre from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous)
I knew I could take him
Stared' at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes... [CHORUS]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
Cuz that's how I beat Shaq[X2]
So check it out
I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks
Was he hitting those shots?
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, that I could change the pace
I said, Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess your getting nervous
Cuz you already lost[CHORUS]
Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man[X2]
Announcers were shocked
Couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up
I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
but the ball went in
Then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too
And we can still be friends
The fans went nuts
They put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice
And it sounded like my mother's
(Get up for school, you're gonna be late!)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing the game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal?
Woah...[CHORUS]


[Chorus 1]
3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Slap
Clap Pat! Clap your hand...

Clap Slap! Clap your hand...
Slap your thigh and sing a little song[Chorus 2]
My mama told me if I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My Aunty told her, I shoulda told her
No I'm not kidding
That's what she told her
3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Clap Clap! 
Clap your hands and prepare to Pat
Take your right arm 
Pat your partner?r palm with your right palm

Take your hand to your palm and slap your thigh 
And watch the fun materialize 
As you sing this little song: [Chorus 2]
(whisper)[Chorus 1][Chorus 2 (x2)]
That's what she told her
I don't believe It
Yeah right
Can you believe it?[Chorus 1]


My grandma and your grandma
Were sittin' by the fire.
My grandma told your grandma
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire" [Chorus:]
Hey now! Hey now!

My flag boy and your flag boy
Were sittin' by the fire.
My flag boy told your flag boy
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire"[Chorus]
See that guy all dressed in green ?
Iko Iko unday 
He's not a man He's a lovin' machine.
Jockamo fee nan?[Chorus x 2][Fade to end]


[Talking:]
Sometime, someplace
Everybody has words
Fallin' out, and making up
Uh-huh[Chorus]
Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal
But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, adjusting to the sound
You and I get, everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time
(Yeah, yeah)
1, 2, 3, 4
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane
You and I have much to give
Everything is relative
When we have our darker days
We just go our seperate ways
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane[Chorus]
Sometimes baby in your eyes
Love is truely justified
When I hear you tellin' lies
I just wanna terorize
Making up is oh so good
Yeah we rock the neighbourhood
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane[Chorus]
(la la la la la la la)[Chorus]


Are you tired, of me
Do you want to, be free
I just got to know
Should I hang on, or let go
Don't keep me guessing
It just ain't fair
You got me drowning in a sea of despair
I've held up for as long as I can
Ohhh I need to know, am I still your man[Chorus]
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do
Na na na na
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do
Na na na na na na
Putting pressure, on my heart
Maybe we need some time apart
We need to find out what's gone wrong
Before the love's completely gone
I've held up for as long as I can
I need to know am I still your man
I'll be past the point, of no returns
Is there a reason to be concerned[Chorus]
Give me a chance 
to say what's left of my pride
Please tell me girl
Is the grass greener on the other side[Chorus]


I see you every day
and I can't seem to think
of anything to say
Do you baby
How can that be
that it breaks my heart 
when you're smilin at me
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true[CHORUS]
Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you Shine like that stars in the sky
In you I see something I won't find ever again
Baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true[REPEAT CHORUS][BRIDGE]
Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're gonna make my dream come true
You know I never would leave you
I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart
Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl You shine(shine)
Shine(shine)

[Aaron:] Well, I guess the best way for me to begin is
The Other day I was hanging with some friends
Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
So everyone screamed[Group of Kids:] Hey is this some kinda trick[Dopey Guy:] Yea, which one is he?[Aaron:] The Blonde One, Nick
Then the cutest girl said:[Girl:] I have to see their show
But I have no ticket, Aaron
How can I go[Aaron:] Your wish is my command
See it's no problem, hon
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
All I gotta is pick up the celly
And its a done deal
Let me call Nick and tell him[Other Guy:] By the way Aaron, if you could, while you're at it
Can you hook up some seats
For my friends and my parents?[Aaron:] So I said to myself, well heck, why not?
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got[Chorus (girls):] Aaron, Oh Aaron
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
([Aaron:] man)
How gonna make them come true?
([Aaron:] I don't know)
Aaron, Oh Aaron,
What are we going to do with you?
Always a makin' a bigger mistake
Always a-makin' a fool
([Aaron:] Yo, I gotta make a phone call)[Ring][Nick:] Hello?[Aaron:] Hey Nick
I need a favor from you, dude
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through[Nick:] Sure, bro...how many do you need?[Aaron:] 1...2...uh, 3003[Nick:] WHAT?!
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
What did you do? 
How'd you get in this mess?[Aaron:] I was talkin to this girl...[Nick:] Hold your breath
I know the rest
Guess you better get yourself a whole lotta money[Aaron:] For 3000 tickets?
Nick, that's isn't funny.
How'm I supposed to pull that off in so little time?[Nick:] You got me, Aaron
That's your problem...not mine[Chorus (girls):] Aaron, Oh Aaron
([Aaron:] What do I do?)
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
([Aaron:] What?)
How gonna make them come true?
Aaron, Oh Aaron, 
([Aaron (annoyed):] What?)
What are we going to do with you?
([Aaron:] I don't know)
Always a makin' a bigger mistake 
([Aaron:] So, it was just one mistake)
Always a-makin' a fool
([Aaron:] Whatever)[Aaron:] How in the world can he do that to me?
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
We're gettin' to the show
We'll get good seats
Everyone on the bus, you're all coming with me
I'm tellin' you guys when we get to the gate
He can never say "no" when he looks at my face
Hook me up! Nick, Man, I swear I'll pay you back[Nick:] Well come to think about, we need an opening act.[Aaron:] What do you want me to do: tell jokes; dance; act?[Nick:] Nah, I want you on stage, I want you to rap. 
'Cause if you don't you're gonna have some disappointed friends
And by the way you're on at eight, that's when the show begins[Chorus (girls):] Aaron. Oh, Aaron, what are you going to do?

You make big promises oh so big
How you gonna make it come true?

Yo my man. Get behind the wheels
Time to cruise. You snooze, you lose
Let me introduce you to my friends
In the other car right behind us
And my other friends in the car
Right behind them, start a Caravan
Crank it up and let it pump
We're gonna make a kriss kross jump
It's the drivin' anthem
And when it's time to hit the road
Feel the heat, crash
Ready to explode

Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio

We need atleast 10 rows
As we roll east
And then it's time to
Go to the Backstreet show
Or the Britney Spears show
Cuz it's starring me, yo
We'll be in the crowd
Hypin' up the party
I want the best reception
For each and everybody
So when I hit the stage
Show me love, don't be rude
And afterwards get my brother
Burn rubber dude
When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me didiyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so
Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all

Everybody come and follow me
That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up
That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up
Sing a song, you know it don't stop
In every single city
People singing in their cars
From mommies to daddies
Who drive cuz they're daddies
In every single bus, baby
To and from school
Everybody feels a rush
And it's time to act cool
When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me didiyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so
Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all
Everybody like that y'all
Everybody come and follow me[Repeat chorus and fade...]


See you walking down the street
Every single day
Girl you never seem to have a smile on your face
What you need is someone who would treat you right
From the morn' til the noon, the noon til the night
Ain't no doubt about what I would do
I'd make a long list
I think you'd approve
You gotta think big
If you wanna succeed
I've got plans girl
It's you and me
Yo, ever since we met
Way back in the day
I'm thinking how to put it
Girl, what can I say
To make you understand how far I'd go
For your heart girl, I just want you to know
That I'd do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would
Like Evil Kenevil
Jumps a cannon like an eagle I'll be your super hero
Protect you from evil
Like batman, spiderman, superman
I can be a man
Be my Jane, I'll be Tarzan
Romeo for Juliet
She'll never have another
Scully and Mulder
They were made for each other
Babe Ruth and his bat
Tiger Woods and Nike hat
Can't you see, girl
That we go together like that
One thing I'd like to mention
I'd give ya every second
Of my full attention
I'd give all of this
Ya know that I could
So gimme one chance
To say - I would
I'll do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would
Ya see, I wanna create

There's somethin' that
I've got to say
You're always with me
Even though, you're far away
Talkin to you on my cell
Just the sound of your voice
Makes my heart melt
Oh girl, well it's true
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have
To question my love
And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are going out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you
I know you worry sometimes,
Some other girl will make me forget you're mine
There's not a doubt in this world
That anyone could take the
Place of my number one girl
It's true
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have
To question my love
And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are going out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you
When i close my eyes i can see you
It's like your right here
And this feeling's only gettin' stronger
You're with me everywhere
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have 
To question my love
And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are goin' out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you

Can you tell me why things gotta be this way 
I'd rather be at the pool catchin' sunrays 
Guys in the deep end 
Girls in the shallow 
Kids in the middle shout "MARCO POLO!" 
When a get a little older Imma change things 
Makin' life go easy like ice cream 
Become president and play on the dream team 
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies 
But I guess right now Imma sit back 
While I watch Scooby-Doo eat a Scooby snack 
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack 
And do a little homework for my math class 
So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you 
Ha ha, ha ha 
Woah

Lacing the beats 
Here to the streets 
Bringing the heat 
Copping the chicks 
Dropping yo mix 
Never forget what, what, what being a kid is 
Even though I got a lot of dough 
I keep it real 
I still play my Sega Dreamcast 
When I chill 
Nickelodeon on while I'm eatin' meals 
And I bought the big screen with the Zomba Deal 
Listen up, to you kids all across the land 
I still rock my Timberlands every time I can
Never miss an episode of the Batman 
Still watching re-runs of the X-Man 
And I still show love to my parents 
Do chores when I'm home from running errands 
Come to the crib, eat a ham sandwich 
And when I'm around ya, you know what
I'm wearing, Timberlands 
So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you

Never wanna change when the get a certain age 
Not me AC, gonna be this way 
Stay this way, always say yo, yo

Okay, this is how it went down
Sunday afternoon with the fellas at the play-ground
Chillin', my father honked his horn at me
Said I have a show in Texas
And I gotta leave
Texas, wow I've never been
Maybe I can find a new hang out friend
Anyway, packin' up my bags on my way
Signin' autographs as I run to catch the plane
I seen her, chubby cheeks with long braids
Cute face, same age
She played hard to get, as I offered out my name
She just walked away with a smile
Oh my little cowgirl

She's been on my mind so much I can't stand it
My manger kept rushin' me to go
I tried to look for her. I'd give a ticket to the show
I thought I see a cowboy hat. But everyone was ready
And our luggage was packed
Hesitant for leavin' my heavensent cowgirl
We ran off to the hotel
As I practisin' in the hotel lobby
She was on my mind full time
The fellas tryin' to cheer me up
I came down with a case of Puppy Love
I went back to havin' fun
Dancin' makes ya thirsty
Plus it was time for lunch at the hotel restraunt
Order me some burgers and fries
Then to my surprise, walked in my cowgirl
Yippie-ki-yo-yippie-yay

I met myself a cowgirl
Put me on
Break it down little lady
Break it down little lady
Break it down
I met myself a cowgirl
Put me on
And now I'm on the stage
Performing infront of a capacity
Screamin' guys and screamin' girls
But still no sign of my cowgirl
As I head to the other front part of the stage
There she stood, with a smile on her face
My cowgirl, took her by the hand
Brought her onstage and I started to dance
With my cowgirl
Yippie-ki-yo-yippie-yay

Do your hands shake, baby

Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down

Trouble with the bass vibration
Race the impact
Of my new track
Take cover cause

Tracks are wickie wickie whack

From the east, to the west
To the north, to the south

Nana nanana Nana nanana
Nana nanana
Let me break it down
I remember sunny days
Chillin' on the beach
And catchin' rays
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere
Listenin' to CDs after dark
Outkast blastin Rosa Parks
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do
Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you when it's like that
To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls that held it down with me
To all the girls that gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me
Nana nanana
Nana nanana

Grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leaving all you cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody's hyped to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
For the summertime 
I've been working real hard 
For just one reason 
I've been waiting all year 
For just one season 
The season that reminds me of palm trees 
The smell, the ocean breeze 
And the sense of being free 
Barbecues and pool parties 
What I call fun 
Hanging with the honey's 
And enjoying the sun 
Spendin' 4 hours just to clean the Benz 
So you can cruise down the 
boulevard with your friends 
Sights on the beach have got your mind blowing 
Drinks on the chill 
The money is flowing 
Right here is where you belong

For the summertime 
Had to take a sip of Ma's Homemade 
Freshly squeezed lemonade 
Check out the honeys in my brand new shades 
As they lay on the sand 
Topping up on the tans 
Take in the scenery 
The mood is fine 
Nobody's wearing their watches 
Nobody's checking the time 
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mine 
That's the summer the summer

Those simple days
Just you and me, mmmm
I think baby I know
What's on your mind
Cuz you look like you've
Got something to say
I may not say those words anymore
But maybe it just ain't my way
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you
Remember we used to laugh and say
No one understood our way
And there were times
When you would cry
And came knocking
On my door
And I was there
To shelter your pain
I think baby you should
Get that off your mind
Make it seem like
A brighter day
I may not say those words anymore
But maybe I can make it my way
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you
The answer girl
Lies within your heart
Take a look inside
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you
In you, in you

Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along
Gonna get it along fine
I got the skills
If you got the style
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
Take people home
To a hip hop beat
Knock me down
Knock me off my feet
Whip one up
Let's get on the with the show
Oh yeah, the way to go
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
Nanana nananana
Nanana na nananana
Nanana nananana
Nanana na nananana
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true


Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Six thirty mama get you out of bed
e-mail what you gonna wear to you girlfriend
Skip you Breakfast, forget your backpack
When your half way, and you runback
Your daddy's angel with a halo
Everybody's looking at you more like a J. Lo
There is so much more to you
So put me to the test
I don't have to guess
What you wanna know now baby
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
Now your middle name is August
But I remember you were born in November
You lived in Jersey but you from Ontario
Your twin sister likes to talk in stereo
We got so much in common
Like Jane & Reeds with lots of Bottom
But there's more we could do
So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
What you wanna know now baby
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
I want you to know
Baby I've been studying
Pulling all nighters
When I could've been partying
I can't fail
It's in the details
Understanding all that which is female
Some guys don't ever see what they're missing
Talking about themselves when they should be listening
I pay attention to things you say to me
When it comes to you
It's in my memory
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it when it when it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What you what your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it goes to you

Ain't no distance we'll take it like that
The grassy ain't green ah ah

From the valleys to the hill to the town
All the friends and fam mama you know
Everybody come together make a half black
White Spanish Chinese
Show me what you got
Troubled times bring
About troubled vibes
I chill you out, baby
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere in between
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dream

I've been around on this journey
And I'm learning
As the world keeps turning
You got a face to fight
Just to live the dream
Who could've believe
That one of achieved
Who would have ever guessed
It would be like that
(Come on)
But through it all
Who's been there for me
To care for me
Even shed a tear for me
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)
It's a dream that
I've come so far
The ups and downs were there
But I've worked so hard
Many people don't know the life I live
Always on the road, always planning the show
Getting down to business in the studio
I can face the day cause the love you give
Through it all when the day is done
The nights begun
You're still my No. 1
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)
One shout to my family
Cause when things get hard you understand me
Two shouts to my boys at home
Although I'm not there you know you're not alone
Three shouts to my label
Cause with them I would not be able to make the fourth
Shout out the ones I think about
Masterpiece to the masterplan
That's you the fans
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me)


When I look into your sad eyes
It makes me feel for you

You're gonna make it through
I wanna see you

AC, AC
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Shoulda known something was up 
When I got up 
Something felt funny to me 
From the get up
Jumped up out of the bed
With my head up
Guess who was staring at me? 
An ET or an alien 
But he said his name was Steve 
And he didn't look like what I thought he would be 
He said "Aaron, will you help me please 
Get your space suit and come with me"
So we hoped up, in the space truck 
It was all combed out with the system up
And I thought we were going to Mars 
We made a left 
At the dipper
Never figured that we'd be here with a space majiggy
We got there and I read a sign 
It said "Welcome AC, it's about time 
Can you show us, 
Can you help us, 
To dance tonight? 
'Cause we have no rhythm 
And we’re running outta time"
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation
Listen up 
Here’s what you got to do 
You take one step up 
Don't try to take two 
Make sure that you bump your fists like this
Nod like this, and rock like this
Cuz everybody gotta learn this way
To a be together, stay together
Know we gonna inovate
Moonwalk, star drop
A universal big top
Circus notice, and you gotta know this 
It really doesn't matter
If you're short or tall
Green or blue 
Fat or bald 
'Cause I came with a groove 
And I'm proving it all 
Around these parts we don't take no show 
With the unity soon to be in the streets
You can see with your own eyes
How far we've come
'Cause we didn't have rhythm, now we've got some
It's just another day in the AC Nation
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation
You say you wanna dance 
Well, here’s your chance 
(Uh, uh) 4-3-2-1 
Break it down, we gonna break it on down 
(Uh, uh)
Right, right to left 
(Uh, uh)
Right, right to left 
Up and down and side to side
C’mon, what, we're gonna bounce like this 
What, what. We gonna pump them fists, what 
AC baby, AC baby, that's where we at C’mon, drop it down 
4-3-2-1
Drop it down
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat don't stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation[Repeat chrorus and fade...]

I turn off the radio
All the windows down
Still seems like your right here beside me
Down every back street
There’s a memory
Can’t believe the way, I still see your face in everything
It won’t stop, no matter where I’m runnin’
You don’t stop, your love just keeps on hauntin’ me
I can’t stop, forgetting that it’s over
But still I’m never alone
Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (city lights)
Look for the sunrise, live for the daylight
That’s the only time I find that you’re not right on my mind
Don’t let the sun go down cause that’s when it happens
It’s getting closer, I feel it comin’ tonight
It won’t stop, no matter where I’m runnin’
You don’t stop, your love just keeps on hauntin’ me
I can’t stop, forgettin’ that it’s over
But still I’m never alone
Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (Ohhh, city lights)
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovin’ the night
Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
(Let me go, set me free) 
The city lights
(Ohhh, city lights)
(let me go, set me free)
The city lights
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovin’ the night

Bad luck and trouble
Get out of my way
My lady fortune's
Coming to stay
Don't need no bullshit
No mister Big
Don't need no contract
No papers to rig
I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's
Coming back again
I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more
Bad luck and trouble
Get out of my face
You're just a loser
Get off of my case
Can't stand the thunder
Can't keep me down
You're going nowhere
Stop messing around
I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's
Coming back again
I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more
Bad luck and trouble
Are passing me by
Your days are numbered
It's your turn to cry
No time for losers
With nothing to say
Sunshine and blue skies
Are heading my way
I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more


Way behind the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground
My reign will be a super-awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
I'm going to be a noble king
So enemies beware
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Nobody saying do this
Nobody saying be there
Nobody saying stop that
Nobody saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way
I wanna be king
(HOLD)
Nobody saying do this
Nobody saying be there
Nobody saying stop that
Nobody saying see here
Free to run around all day, yeah
I’ll be free to do it my way
The time has come
As someone said
To talk of many things
This may be true
But I would rather stick to talking kings
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine
The monarchy is waiting to go zing, yeah
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh... Oh... Oh I just can't wait to be king
Oh, yeah... oh oh oh
King of the world, yeah
Oh (Oh)... Oh (Oh)... Oh I just can't wait to be king
I wanna be king
Come on


[Verse 1]
I got a friend and I may just get him
Ready and a push with a mic in my right hand
Move you, groove you
Get something to dance to, if you want to
Step outside, come along, let's ride
Don't listen to the talk, take a walk on the wild side
Thinkin', talkin', clockin', everybody's shockin', and rockin[Bridge]
Cause you know and I know
that we rule the dance floor
If the DJ's too slow-slow
I guess that it's a no-no, no-no
If I say...[Chorus]
Jump jump to say how high
Jump jump to the left to the right
Jump jump and turn around
Jump jump and touch the ground[x2][Verse 2]
Ain't gonna mix with the latest craze
Everybody's thinking it's just a phase
But they don't about going out, showing out, and hanging out
And don't know the rules about...[Bridge][Chorus][Rap:]
Say boomity boom boom, boombastick
Fun fun fun, funtastick
Swing the nation
Cause a sensation
Or good vibration
??
Somebody, anybody, everybody
SCREAM!
Yo, Aaron, where you at, man?[Chorus x2, fade out]


It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
And ya know we're gonna groove
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
Leave it up, leave it up to me
Listen to the kids
Grown up, sewn up
Even when they mess up
Actin' like it's all sewn up
Mom and dad think we
Need to have a talk
Think the kids rule the world
Boys and girls
You can't blame us for notta
You taught us, to follow orders
Cuz I'm the baby, dun gotta
Monkey see (ah ah)
Monkey do no more
The fun stops here
What's the score
We might start a play fight
Just to imitate you
Donchya feel silly now
Shame on you
Don't start to cry now
I don't blame you
Afterall your just a grown-up
Whachya gonna do
It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up

Gonna hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me
When the grown-ups go awol
Who ya gonna call
Here come the young ones
The baby crime busters
Big people, listen up
Relax now we're equal
And if the money's right
Then we might make a sequal
Do I hear a "please"?
I love it when you beg me
I need a bribe now
Just to move my legs, see
And I might fit you in
If you make way

Mom and dad, they be
Gettin' on my nerves
Workin' em, workin' em
Is that what I deserve
But after many days
Hey, I want them back
Tell me who's gonna bake
My cake and all that
Who's gonna suffer from
My practical jokes
And answer when I'm moving
Hey, it's gotta be my folks
And who's gonna get me up
Ready for the flight
And who's gonna tell me
"Everything's alright"
But wait a minute
That sounds so soft
That won't impress a
Hot chicka that I cross
Don't play me out cuz
I'll switch ya off
You've been told old for too long
Singin' the same song
If you're old enough to vote
Then it's time to sit down
It's all about the little hommies
Takin' the crown
So if you're too young to vote
Here's your chance to have a say
Come on everybody
Help me save the day
It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal. Doncha know I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gotta hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me
It's the kids

I used to love a girl
Sometimes I still think I do
Thinking about her makes me a little crazy (crazy)
She used to be my world
How could we be split in two
We were just like peas in a pod (a pod, a pod)
I'm offically losing my mind
Chasing behide her heart (her heart)
This just can't be real
So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go
I tried to play the field
Lost my share in one a few
I never really hit one out the park
No, I guess I wasn't healed
Trying to forget the truth
Life without you left me with a scar
I'm offically losing my mind
Chasing behide her heart (her heart)
This just can't be real
So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go
So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
I gotta let her go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

Just a song where is feeling show [The Moffats]
And if someone feels the same about the simple song [Gil]

And maybe you can hear them sing [Nick-BSB]
Music gives you Happiness and Sadness [`N Sync]
But it also [Blumchen] it also heals your soul [Chorus][Brian-BSB]
Let the music heal your soul
let the music take control

Hey girl
Keep your head high
I never said I
Wouldn't be back when I'm
Leavin' on the red eye
Gotta do this show so I can get my dough
Lookin' up at the house on top of the hill
Where we can drop and get ill
A little spot we can chill
Or hide out whenever things get real
Shorty, wontcha tell me how ya feel
If I will
How can I be sure
If your love remains here
Well, I gotta go
Until we get this clear
Ya just gotta know
When you're not there I be so tight
No matter what I try, it won't go right
My shorty
Cause you got my back
My shorty
You keep it real like that
My shorty

Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
On tour 2 months 8 weeks 60 days later
I threw so many groupies off
One I even made her cry
Had to tell her I really didn't hate her right
Couldn't wait awhile
'cause we had to say goodbye
I never thought that I
Would never see that day that I
Fall for her the way that I did
So I will say that I
Never stray cause I find a better way when
I hold it down and keep it tight
Could never say goodbye
My shorty
'cause you got my back
My shorty
We keep it real like that
My shorty
I wanna be where ya at
My shorty
That's why I'm FELLIN' like that

I come from a bottom of hate but I made it
I’ve been dead broke and I’ve been famous, yeah
I’m not afraid to get dirty
I’ve seen concrete grown roses
But you know it’s not an easy life
Yeah we all get a second try
And it don’t matter what you have
Or the cars you drive
It’s gonna be a crazy ride
You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud there’s a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know
Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together
Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life
Yeah my 99 problems ain’t gon’ stop me
I got air to breathe and my heartbeat and you can
Try to hold me down
I know exactly who I’m gonna be[?] where life can [?]
But that don’t mean that no one loves ya
You know you gotta keep your head up
Yeah you gotta keep your head up
You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud there’s a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know
Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together
Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life
Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together
Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life


She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (she's coming out of thin air) 
She blew in like the wind 
Became more than just a friend 
And now I just can't wait to see her face again 
That girl so beautiful, got a body I can't forget 
She got style, she got class 
And her smile's like the sunset 
I can see the lighting , I can hear the thunder 
I can feel her heartbeat, but I can't find her 
I can feel the rain all over my face 
Like a hurricane, she's taking me away.... 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
Came out of nowhere 
I was not prepared 
Almost time to evacuate, I feel it getting near 
The sky is getting dark, and now I'm getting scared 
She got style, she got class 
The girl is a perfect storm... 
I can see the lighting, I can hear the thunder 
I can feel her heartbeat, but I can't find her 
I can feel the rain all over my face 
Like a hurricane, she's taking me away... 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air)


[Kayla:] Give me a world that's equal on all sides[Aaron:] Let freedom flow as constant as the tides[Kayla:] I pray with each sunset, don't forget to rise[Aaron:] (Don't forget to rise)[Kayla:] I live without regret[Both:] For ordinary lives[Both:] I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes[Aaron:] I see a land with liberty for all[Kayla:] Yet still I know the truth will rise and fall[Aaron:] (Oooh yeah-yeh)
That's just the way it goes[Both:] A word now to the wise
The world was made to change
Each day is a surprise[Both:] Lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
Looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes[Both:] And I know when you're looking for the truth
(Mmmhmm)
If you go and read between the lines
You'll discover how and why[Aaron (rap):] I take my heart into battle
Give that freedom bell a rattle
Get my independence signed
Declare it on the dotted line
In Philidelphia freedom ring
And patriotic voices sing
Red White & Blue never give up
We represent America[Both:] I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes


It's been to long
I've been waiting to see you
Endless nigths I lie awake thinging what went wrong
I'm afraid that it's too late but I'm still hanging on
Where have you gone, mother
It's been so long since I've seen you
Can someone take me home
I can't take this anymore, mama
Are you thinking of me
Do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh
Is it worth a life time of bitter seperation
How can we forgive when all we want is...
Vindicationnn
I shut you out of my life
Erased you from my mind
Hey
Changed my number
Went to hide
But I still feel you inside
Where have you gone, mother
Do you know how much I love you
Can someone take me home
Can you take me home
Where I belong
Are you thinking of me?
Do your days feel empty?
Do you look at the photographs, the ones that use to make us laugh?
Is it worth a life time of pain and separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Are you thinking of me?
And do your days feel empty?
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh?
Is it worth a life time of bitter separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Ohhhh woah oooh
Is it worth a life time?
Ohhhhhhhh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh


Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
Where things move a little slower
And people always wave goodbye and say hello
And the maples on this road they must be three hundred years old
Just imagine all the stories they could tell
Of the tractors and the cars
All comin' home from Liston's bar
And the country folk just out to raise some hell
To raise some hell
This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
So I just hit the ground and keep on runnin'
All of yesterday has come and gone
And so you try to pick up all the pieces
Put it all back the way that it belongs
Well the next thing that you know
It's time to play another show
I'm leavin' out of here just after dawn
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back when you are gone
When you are gone
And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
And my amendment rights
They keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my amendment rights
Keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
And the story never ends
Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home
To what I know


If I could walk on water, like Jesus did before,
If I knew all the answers, to keep you coming back for more,
If I could paint a picture, and then cut off my own ear,
If I chose all the right colors, would this just disappear?
Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,
If I could write a poem, and find the perfect words,
And then put them all to music, just so my voice gets heard,
Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,
So if I could walk on water, like Jesus did before,
And if I knew all the answers, I'd keep you coming back for more,
Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
And yet we still remain,
We run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,
Yet we still remain


Well I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for 1500 bucks back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker back in the day he put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey is known to change a man
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but I smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of 1200 off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
Now it's been 12 years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.
He said "sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play"
He set up shop on sunset, he put me up at the marquee
He said "you wanna sell a million records boy you better listen to me"
He said "change your style, whiten your smile, you could lose a couple of pounds
And if you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?"
I said, no that's not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be
Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my 9 or 45
I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
And my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks
And as a country boy you know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The red, the white, the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
"Don't tread on me" is what it says and I'll take that to my grave
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
Cause my family has always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family
I love the way it is now, and anybody that tries to change it
Has to come through me, that should be all our attitudes
'cause this is America and a country boy is good enough for me son


You're my world
The shelter from the rain
You're the pills
Then take away my pain
You're the light
That helps me find my way
You're the words
When I have nothing to say
In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
Still tangled up in you
I'm Still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you
You're the fire
That warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold
as I grow old.
You're the shore
When I am lost at sea
You're the only thing
That I like about me.
In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
I'm still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
How long has it been
Since this storyline began
And I hope it never ends
And goes like this forever
In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
Still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you


Sing here on the stairs and listen to
The nighttime as the daylight fades away
It's such a haunting and familiar tune
When I hear it in the distance I can say
That I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me...
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I'm home
The north shore is where my father lives
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride
But the Berkshires are where my heart is
And when I see them in the distance I could cry
Because I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me...
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Nyla started pre-school and Indy just turned two
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
They keep getting older, time keeps going by
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry
So I just pass the sign that welcomes me to Worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that hasn't really changed with time
The way this country that I love, it used to be
Because I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my hero teaches classes everyday
When my friends, they don't treat me different
It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay
Because I'm home


I'm starting to hate all these cigarettes
And this lonely town
And I'm starting to fade like the lines on route 143
Sometimes I feel like I might wont get off this ride
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75
And this highway ain't no place home for lovers and drifters like me
All the hotels and bars
Rides in stretch cars ain't for me
I'm tired of missing the moments I'll never get back
And I'm tired of missing the smiles on my little girl's face
Sometimes i feel like i might wont get off this ride
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75
And this highway ain't no place home for lovers and drifters like me
All the hotels and bars
Rides in stretch cars ain't for me
Sometimes I feel like I might
Wont get off this ride
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75


There's a thousand miles and eighteen hours I've got a double drive down southbound 35
Got the hammer down, detroit made 525 pushing' my ass right down that line
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
I've got a full-grown creeping' up on my tail, no I won't make bail in this small town jail no not right here
I've got the bird dog on, radio cranked, gear jammin lane changin son of a bitch you betcha son
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
Just left the jail with a handful of pills and I won't quit til I hit the coup in Abiline
I'm almost there, there's just a few more miles, I'll make the drop, I'll turn and burn I'm outta here
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road


In the mornin' on a Saturday
I got my girls and we're skippin' town
In my '67 442 got the rag top down
Aldean's on the radio
Ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes me smile just a little bit because it's not a Miley Cyrus song
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer.
Now we're at our little getaway
Zoe go and grab the fishin' poles
I can't think of any better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh striper on the grill tonight
Cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise, another story I can tell
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer.
Monday morning and it's gettin' late
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldean's on the radio and my three girls know every line
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the music's right
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
These endless summer nights.


My grandmama worked on a factory floor,
Sewing leather for minimum wage,
While my granddaddy worked all the beer joints in town,
Tryin' to forget the memories he made.
Because when daddy was born in 1945,
We'd been fighting for what we believed.
Along with five other brothers, who stood by his side
They were ready they were willing to bleed.[Chorus:]
Red, white and blue
Those colors mean something
Those colors stay true.
Like my family before me,
I'll feel it too.
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
My daddy grew up, on the wrong side of poor
Rubbin' nickels together for heat.
Well, he and his sister had barely got by
With the clothes and the shoes on their feet.
So he joined the service when he was 18
Like his daddy and his uncles before.
He was ready to die for what he believed
To fight for what's worth fightin' for[Chorus:]
Red, white and blue
Those colors mean something
Those colors stay true.
Like my family before me,
I'll feel it too.
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
Well me and my sisters got kids of our own
And my brothers comin up on sixteen
And my daddy taught us all how to live off the land
And how to stand up for what we believe[Chorus:]
Red, white and blue
Those colors mean something
Those colors stay true.
Like my family before me,
I'll feel it too.
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
Like my family before me
I feel it too
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
The blood that's in my veins
Runs red white and blue


I've walked a mile in the shoes of a broken man
I've fallen down a thousand times and got up again
there's times I've talked to god like he's my only friend
There's time it seems the devil's trying to take me by the hand
In life, sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you
I'll borrow pages from the life of johnny cash
I've tried to find the answer in the whiskey glass
I've done a lot of things back in my shady past
I've sat on that metal bed living way too fast
Cause in life sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you
And these pictures running through my head as I sat there on that cold metal bed and wonder how I wound up here again
Cause in life you'll find you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you


Another cheap high rise Hotel room.
Another Place another Show.
Another Meaningless...
Destination with nowhere to go.
Another Time to say "I love you"
Another Time to say "good night"
Another Time to hear a dial tone
'Cause no one wants to fight.
Why should we fight?
'Cause I can see it in you're Eyes...
Is the Sparkle gone forever?
Don't say forever!
And I can feel it when we touch...
Is the fire out forever?
Don't say forever!
Another time to miss a Birthday
Another time to miss my Flight
I've missed so much, that I don't know what I have
And what I thought I might.
What I might 'cause
I can see it in you're Eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever?
Don't say forever!
And I can feel it when we touch
Is the fire out forever?
Don't say forever!
Now I'm lying beside you...
A stranger in you're Arms.
We drift apart together
And come back like a Storm...
Like a Storm...
Another Show up in Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this Equator,
Takes me far away from Home
I'm coming Home 'cause
I can see it in you're eyes
The sparkle shines forever
This is forever
And I can feel it when we touch
The Fire burns forever
'Cause this is forever
I can see it in you're Eyes
The sparkle shines forever
This is forever
I can feel it when we touch
The Fire burns forever
This is forever


It sets above the mantel on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money
And it damn sure ain't for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
Granddaddy's gun
He bought it new out of the Sears and Roebuck catalog
And it shot a many shells over the back of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun.[Chorus:]
It's just an old double barrel twelve
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what means to me to no one
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder,
"A gun's like a woman son, it's all how you hold her."
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
My granddaddy's gun
He handed it to me on the day I turned thirteen
With a half shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
And granddaddy's gun[Chorus:]
It's just an old double barrel twelve
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what means to me to no one
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder,
"A gun's like a woman son, it's all how you hold her."
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
My granddaddy's gun
There's a long beard hanging on the livin' room wall
That I got with a box call and granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up stop sign on forty nine
That me and Billy Joe took out one night
With granddaddy's gun
It sets above the mantel on a couple rusty nails
It ain't worth a lot of money
But it damn sure ain't for sale


I just left out of corpus and I'm heading into Nashville for the day
I left my mark on music row, now back out on the road, more shows to play
I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've played concert halls and holes in walls and places that a show just shouldn't be
There's stadiums and late night shows on every major network on TV
And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
Well, I just left West Virginia, one more in Wabash and Then I'll come home
I can take this guitar off my back and hang up these ol boots cause I'm gone
And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've followed yellow lines til I can't see
I'll never know where this road's takin' me


This road is going nowhere
And these, these shoes are worn too thin
There's always should-haves where I'm going
There's always could-haves where I've been.
And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here.
There's always footsteps from behind me
Why don't they ever read the writing on the wall
And all the time I've spent rewinding
It might mean nothing, it might mean nothing at all
And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here.
The bed next to me is empty
Just like the, the shell I'm still trying to fill
The things put in life to tempt me
They won't ever, they might break my will
And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here. Wish I was anywhere but here.


I've been hard up and torn down, the things I've been through
And the angels won't take me... away
And I've talked to St. Peter, he won't let me pass
So it looks like I'm going today.
So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Waylon and Whitley as well
And The Devil will be dealing' the cards as they lay
So let's have a party in hell
And washed up, and worn down, and down on my knees
The angels won't take me... away
The bartender only serves brown liquor in hell
And that sure sounds like heaven to me
So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Janis and Jim Beam as well
And Rick James will bring all the cocaine you want
So let's have a party in hell
So let's have a party and tell 'em we're home
There'll be no-show and Junior and Merle
And Jamey Johnson will be drinkin' from a brown paper bag
So let's have a party in hell


Last night I saw her face
It made me lose my place, it did
It made me wonder
How did I fumble into space
Can't eat a thing at all
My appetite is way to small, it is
Except for big brown bags
I really love that alcohol
No little girl,
That your kiss ain't what I'm missing
But your loving me,
Loving me, yeah
No little girl,
That your kiss is what I'm missing
And you're twisting me,
Twisting me yeah
No little girl
That your voice wakes me at night
Always pushing me away
Always trying to start a fight
Uh, break it down
The pain washes across me
The things that I thought we'd see, yeah
The pain washes across me
But now we're both strong and free, baby!
Last night we danced real close
That's when she feels the most, it is
Her pace is much to fast
How do I look inside my soul
No little girl
That your kiss ain't what I'm missing
But your loving me,
Loving me, yeah
No little girl
That your kiss is what I'm missing
And you're twisting me,
Twisting me, yeah
No little girl
That your voice wakes me at night
Always pushing me away
Always trying to start a fight

Bobby had everything he thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car and a master's degree
Still he's feeling lost, with no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
Says 'Change a kid's life with just a couple hours a week'
Normally he'd keep clicking, just surfing around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, Sara does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left, its hard to find the strength
She wipes a tear from her eye as she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cause after dinner, baths and homework, there's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids, too tired to fight
No money, no romance, no end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says 'I love you Mom'
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, I know we've got problems
We've got to figure out, baby
Yeah, I know we haven't been talking or touching much lately
But I know this love's
Got a lot of life left in it
Oh, so let me hold you close, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, let me know, we won't wait another minute
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
It can change the world, it can change your mind
It can change your tire in the middle of the night
It can change your name, it can change your heart
It can change your tune, it can change your life


Ooh yeah..
Oh yeah..
Across the miles, it's funny to me
How far away you are, but how near you seem to be
I could talk all night just to hear you breathe
Spend my life just living this dream
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
With all the loves I used to know
I kept my distance, yeah, I never let go
But in your arms, I know I'm safe
Cause I've never been held and I've never been kissed in this way
Yeah, you're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been, I've never been this
Close enough to see it's true
Close enough to trust in you
Closer now than any words can say
And when I'm in your arms
Need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been.. I've never been
Darling, I swear
I've never been.. I've never been this close


I'm tired of living in this bubble
So today I'm changing everything
Well, my dream's been buried in the rubble
It's time to set it free
No more keeping quiet this life inside of me
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Starting right now, I'm gonna start living out loud
Oh, yeah
Well, I'm not breaking any new ground
And I didn't reinvent the wheel
I'm just a man who finally figured out
What he really needs
So I'm turning up the volume of this song inside of me
Gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
All my demons, I have fought 'em
Inhibitions, I have lost 'em
It wasn't easy, but I taught 'em
To just get out of my way
And now, every breath I'm breathing,
The air is so much sweeter
Now that my heart has finally found a way
To start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here and now
I'm gonna start living out loud
Living out loud
Living out loud


She said, I dont even know you anymore
Were barely friends, we used to be lovers
I remember when I was all that you were living for
Now, were just living in this house like strangers
I tried to give to you everything I thought you ever wanted
To make this house a home
You still lay next to me, but all I feel is alone
How can I make you see
That a kiss is worth a thousand words
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses
Cant change the way I miss being reassured
When youd hold me close, look into my eyes and press your lips to mine
If you really wanna tell me that you love me
Want your feelings to be heard
A kiss is worth a thousand words
He just sat there on the couch looking surprised
He couldnt believe what he was hearing
It was like shed opened up his heart and reached inside
And told him everything that he was feeling
He said, I tried to give to you everything I thought you ever wanted
Been working day and night
I felt this distance too, but I never knew just what to say
To make it right
Till you said a kiss is worth a thousand words
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses
Cant change the way I miss being reassured
When youd hold me close, look into my eyes and press your lips to mine
If you really wanna tell me that you love me
Want your feelings to be heard
A kiss is worth a thousand words
In the middle of the night, they finally got it right
When they both closed their eyes and talked for hours
He told her that he loved her, that he couldnt live without her
But not a single heart was broken, not a single word was spoken
Ooh...yeah, just one kiss
One single kiss
Whoa, a kiss is worth a thousand words
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses
Cant change the way I miss being reassured
When youd hold me close, look into my eyes and press your lips to mind
If you really wanna tell me that you love me
Want your feelings to be heard
Yeah, if you really wanna tell someone you love em
Want your feelings to be heard
A kiss is worth a thousand words


It's Friday night, county road
Seventeen, off we go
It's summertime, not a care in the world
Well I remember
My two best friends and me
Takin' a trip to feel the ocean breeze
Nothing but dreams as far as we could see
Oh I remember
When fillin' that tank would seem like such a big deal
And how the wind in my hair with the sun coming up made me feel
Oh well I ain't complaining (I ain't complaining)
About the way things are (About the way things are)
Not so long ago life was oh so easy now
(Now when that innocence seems so far) When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
Jenny Thompson, our first date
I showed up early, she made me wait
Clumsy conversation with her dad
Well I remember
That bright red dress, the perfect fit
A romantic movie that I let her pick
We were both in the dark dreaming of love
Oh I remember
How her head on my shoulder seemed like such a big deal
And how the touch of her hand and that very first kiss made me feel, yeah
Well I ain't complaining (I ain't complaining)
About the way things are (About the way things are)
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
(Now when that innocence seems so far) When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
Well I've got a thousand reasons to smile these days
I've got a thousand great memories that I can't replace
But when there's weight on my shoulders and tears on my face
Even years from now I know I'll say
I ain't complaining
About the way things are
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
Now when that innocence seems so far
When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
I ain't complaining
About the way things are
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
Now when that innocence seems so far
When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new


first time i saw you girl you lit up the room
but how was i supposed to know
beyond the way that your smile caught my eye
you had something deeper to show
but the power of this emotion has revealed
love is more than what i see, it's what i feel
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
i'd seen so many amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
it's in the way you can make me laugh
and in how you believe in me
how you follow your heart no matter what the path
and how you give so unselfishly
oh, now i'm seeing colours, where there once was only grey
now i know the kind of love that takes my breath away
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
i'd seen so many amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
yeah...
well, the most amazing thing by far
is you don't even know how beautiful you are
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
well, i'd seen so many things, amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
darlin' you are, what beautiful is
what beautiful is


it's been over ten thousand minutes since you said goodbye
and i've thought about that moment at least a million times
you were standing at the kitchen counter, with a single tear in your eye
the day you changed my life
well, i'm still going through the motions
well, i'm still taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
well, i can't smell the roses and the rainbows are just shades of grey
and all those things that made me happy just don't move me the same
i can't help but remember us laughing, the way i held you every night
you made my whole world come alive
well, i'm still going through the motions
well, i'm still taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
well, i was minding my own business, down at our favourite bookstore
contemplating my own existence, when you walked through that door
you asked how i was doing, so i did my best to lie
but i wanted so bad to tell you, what i really felt inside
(i'm going through the motions)
well, i'm just taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you


where am i, what was that
that made my heart beat so fast
i'm somewhere now that i've never been
so far from the world i was living in
baby, i'm lost, but i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
i've come so far, i can't turn back
there was no star, there was no map
well, i followed you to this place
now it's too late, standing here face to face
baby, i'm lost, but i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
it just seems so right to be holding you tight
i never thought it could feel so good to be lost
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
well, i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
baby, i'm lost


Well, I don't claim to know everything
But some things aren't hard to figure out
I can tell your love for me has been fading
And I know what you want to talk about
Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
I felt it skip a beat on the night we met
Moving cautiously at first, then letting go
Yeah, with each passing day, I turn another page
So there ain't much I don't already know
Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
Well, I knew this day was coming
It was there between the lines
Still I was hoping maybe I could change your mind
But that's not gonna happen
No way upon this earth
So just kiss me on last time, but don't say a word
Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
I can read your heart


Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Bobby had everything he thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car and a master's degree
Still he's feeling lost, with no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
Says 'Change a kid's life with just a couple hours a week'
Normally he'd keep clicking, just surfing around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, Sara does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left, its hard to find the strength
She wipes a tear from her eye as she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cause after dinner, baths and homework, there's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids, too tired to fight
No money, no romance, no end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says 'I love you Mom'
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, I know we've got problems
We've got to figure out, baby
Yeah, I know we haven't been talking or touching much lately
But I know this love's
Got a lot of life left in it
Oh, so let me hold you close, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, let me know, we won't wait another minute
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
It can change the world, it can change your mind
It can change your tire in the middle of the night
It can change your name, it can change your heart
It can change your tune, it can change your life


I don't need no sign, don't need no map
Baby, I know right where I'm at with you
I never thought there'd be a time
But when I felt your hand in mine, I knew
So if you're thinking this is something that
Feels so good, it could never last
Let me take that worry from your mind, and I'll tell you
I, I will be there
Like heaven, earth, and water, baby
I wanna breathe the same air
The same air that I know you're breathing, honey
Every morning, noon, and night you'll see
That I'll never be that far out of your reach
I will be there
I must admit I'm new at this
But you've got something I can't resist somehow
Like a horseshoe magnet and a paper clip
Baby, I'm drawn right to your lips right now
So if you're thinking I could walk away
Baby, I'm afraid it's a little late
I've already crossed the promise line
I, I will be there
Like heaven, earth, and water, baby
I wanna breathe the same air
The same air that I know you're breathing, honey
Every morning, noon, and night you'll see
That I'll never be that far out of your reach
I will be there
So if you're thinking this is something that
Feels so good, it could never last
Let me take that worry from your mind, and I'll tell you
I, I will be there
I, I will be there, I swear


Ooh yeah..
Oh yeah..
Across the miles, it's funny to me
How far away you are, but how near you seem to be
I could talk all night just to hear you breathe
Spend my life just living this dream
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
With all the loves I used to know
I kept my distance, yeah, I never let go
But in your arms, I know I'm safe
Cause I've never been held and I've never been kissed in this way
Yeah, you're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been, I've never been this
Close enough to see it's true
Close enough to trust in you
Closer now than any words can say
And when I'm in your arms
Need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been.. I've never been
Darling, I swear
I've never been.. I've never been this close


I'm tired of living in this bubble
So today I'm changing everything
Well, my dream's been buried in the rubble
It's time to set it free
No more keeping quiet this life inside of me
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Starting right now, I'm gonna start living out loud
Oh, yeah
Well, I'm not breaking any new ground
And I didn't reinvent the wheel
I'm just a man who finally figured out
What he really needs
So I'm turning up the volume of this song inside of me
Gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
All my demons, I have fought 'em
Inhibitions, I have lost 'em
It wasn't easy, but I taught 'em
To just get out of my way
And now, every breath I'm breathing,
The air is so much sweeter
Now that my heart has finally found a way
To start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here and now
I'm gonna start living out loud
Living out loud
Living out loud


I like the sound of the ocean crashing
Waves making their way to the beach
I like the sound of the gulf breeze blowing
Holding your hand, the sand on our feet
I like the sound of raindrops dancing
As we sleep away a Sunday afternoon
And I like the sound of the alarm clock ringing
Means I'll spend another day with you
So turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
I like the sound of a fireplace crackling
Watching a movie, holding you tight
Yeah, I love it when I hear you laughing
At that joke I've told a thousand times
And I like the sound of guitars screaming
Music so loud we talk with our eyes
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
I like the sound of your heart beating
In my arms, right here, right now
When it's so quiet I can hear you breathing
That may be my favourite sound
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that


Baby, how'd we wind up this far apart
Using words as weapons like daggers to our hearts
This standoff of indifference isn't solving anything
But baby, I've been thinking 'bout what I stand to lose
I can live without being right, so if I have to choose
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your...
Footsteps down the hallway, the strength you have within
How much you say in silence, yeah, your breath upon my skin
Don't know who I am without you
Just like the very air I breathe
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
Cause I can't live without your love
As we sit here in the quiet, there's a pounding in my head
I feel the weight of a thousand angry words between us
The bitter things we said
So I'm reaching out to you tonight
Yeah, I don't care who's wrong and baby, I don't care who's right
We've come too far to let this slip away now
I'm asking you, I'm telling you
I'm begging you
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
Can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
I need you, baby


She says don't stare at me
She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
I don't know what she's talking about
She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself
Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone
You can't hide Beautiful
You can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful
She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy
And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of nowhere blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things
A little piece of heaven god gave to this world
She might think she's just an ordinary girl
You can't hide Beautiful
You can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful


Never been the kind of guy who walks around ladders
And I open up umbrellas when I'm inside
Well, black cats that crossed my path, they never mattered
But I've never had this much at stake
Don't want to lose her by tempting fate
So I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together - knock on wood
Well, it's been two weeks and everything is coming up aces
But I've seen my luck come, and I've seen it go
And for the first time in my life, I'm not hesitating
I knew after just one dance, I wasn't leaving this up to chance
I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together - knock on wood, yeah
Well, I've got my rabbit's foot around my neck
That old wishing well's got half my paycheck
Got a bag of four-leaf clovers
Anything to be her lover
Knock on wood
Knock on wood
I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together
I think this could be forever
The two of us together
Knock on wood
Knock on wood

We sat and watched the sun come up
With a blanket wrapped around us
We spend all night out on that beach
Couldn't hold her close enough to me
That was love I won't forget
And I still remember what she said
She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go
The April air, the crescent moon
Two wild hearts with nothing to lose
That weekend was all we had
But what I'd give for two more days like that
She looked at me and said goodbye
And kissed my lips one last time
She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go
Kansas, I'll always remember
Kansas, I hear your name and I am with her
She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go
(Kansas) She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
Oh, no (Kansas)
She called me Kansas


Barry White, he woke me out of my sleep
"Love Unlimited" on infinite repeat
I live alone, so why's the shower running?
My mind is groggy - my memory's foggy
The smell of incense lingers in the bedroom
I can't believe it's already past noon
On my arm there's a strange new tattoo
Shirt on the fan blade - pants on the lampshade
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
Empty bottle of tequila, Jose Cuervo margaritas
Popcorn and a game of Twister
You get the picture... you get the picture
A book of matches on my dresser from the Sky Bar
Doggie bag from Dos Amigos
That valet parker still has the keys to my car
Piece by piece, it's coming back to me
I met my buddies after work
We shot some pool, a couple beers
Before I knew it, we were rocking
Met some girls, we started talking
It's not like me to get nervous, but she was perfect
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
A mariachi band was playing, she was dancing close and swaying
Fireworks when I kissed her
You get the picture
Suddenly, the shower opens in a cloud of steam
Standing there, the woman of my dreams
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
You get the picture
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture


It's way too easy to live this life
With your eyes half-closed, don't I know
I spend half my time bored out of my mind
Sleep walking
Well I wake up to this fool's parade
And I watch the leaves fall down
I see everything changing
But somehow I feel caged in
Just hangin' around
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Something to set me free
Out of the ordinary
Come and rescue me
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
It's that feelin' that's so hard to explain
When the world's so big and you're so small
An you get caught up with the wonder of it all
That's what I'm missing
I saw that look today in a young kid's face
Eating ice cream in a laundromat
And if you asked him it was Christmas again
I wanna get that back
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
A little something to believe
Out of the ordinary
A taste of something sweet
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Yeah Yeah
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Wooohooohoo
I know it's out there
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
A little something to believe
Out of the ordinary
To come and rescue me
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful


She locked her fingers
Bowed her head
She said I'm late
And I'm really scared
You can go
But I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it
Either way
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child
Laid my head
Down on the wheel
She said I know, I know
It don't seem real
She closed her eyes
But the tears broke though
She said don't hate me
For loving you
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child
I could not reassure her
Couldn't say what I had planned
Couldn't put three words together
So I just took her hand
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child


I grew up under normal conditions
Mom was the radio, Dad was the television
They both were doing the best that they could
Working 50 hour weeks and knocking on wood
I did my time in the public school system
I got good grades, never got a shred of wisdom
Can't blame my teachers for anything they did
You can't teach one on one with 33 kids
Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and dying the American way
I found the one, we put some roots down
Got a 2nd mortgage on the outskirts of town
Now we barbecue every 4th of July
Send our prayers and our fireworks up into the sky
Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and loving the American way
These days we're thinking 'bout kids of our own
Gonna turn this house into a home
In no time at all they'll be singing along
Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and dying the American way


Hey mom I know that it's late, hope I didn't wake you
Yeah, everything is O.K., just needed to talk to you
Today I had one of those days
But I didn't call to complain
Just to say everything that I didn't for all of those years
You were a taxicab driver, a nurse and a maid
A waitress, a cook and a shoulder to lay
My head on to cry on, when nothing was going my way
You knew every answer without cracking a book
And I took for granted that I had it so good
And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say
Thank you I love you
Twenty years late
It's funny how time passing by can change your perspective
A little while out on your own can sure make you think
I don't know how you did it
No I can't find one spare minute
The days run together but I don't remember you
Ever letting us down
You were the judge and the jury when I did wrong
Been my biggest fan from my very first song
The gas in the engine that always kept me moving on
A seamstress a counselor and the one referee
That could cold stop a fight between my brother and me
And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say
Thank you I love you
Twenty years late
I'll let you go now
But I hope that you know now how I feel
Thank you for making me the man I've become
I love you and I will always be your son
Mom that's all I called to say
Twenty years late


They're not really expecting me
But I know where they hide the key, under the welcome mat
There's no better place than that
Don't know how long I've been gone
All I know is it's been too long and I'm off track
That's why I'm coming back
When I see the lights of my hometown
I feel like the world stops spinning 'round
Everything makes sense
Maybe it's the innocence
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown
The static is almost gone
From the station I grew up on
I'm getting closer now
So I turn it up real loud
Funny how a little thing like that
Can make it all come rushing back
They say it's not the same
But to me it will never change
When I see the lights of my hometown
I feel like the world stops spinning 'round
Everything makes sense
Maybe it's the innocence
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown


He said let's steal a car, get outta here
I got money for gas and beer
Let's point this car down a two-lane road
Just follow where the headlights go
She said I'm tired of this town anyway
Days go by but things don't change
If I stay here I know I'll die
Without ever really being alive
Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run
She slept in the dashboard light
He stayed awake and drove all night
Ran his fingers through her hair
On their way to everywhere
Morning came and she called home
From an Idaho gas station phone
She slammed the door sat down and cried
Kissed him hard and just said drive
Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run
Love is a fast train, love is a slow rain
You can't stoop it, no you can't stop it......
Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run


That night, that dress
Baby, I must confess
I was tongue-tied, but inside
My mind got way ahead of me
I'm stuck in this confusion
Trapped in some illusion
It's all because of you
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things
Sunlight on you face
Waking up with you each day
My shirt on you
Just the thought's driving me crazy
It's like I'm in a daze
Some kind of lovesick haze
Before I go insane
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things
I'm drunk on love, I'm stoned on you
I'm wasted, your face is
Everywhere I turn
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things


Baby, when you smile at me
I know that you're all I'll ever need
You're my favorite song to sing
You're my raincoat when it rains
With all my heart and soul
I want you to know
I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man
When I look into your eyes
I know that's where I wanna spend my life, the rest of my life
You're my lazy Sunday afternoon
My crazy New Year's Eve, my parachute
And I love your innocence
I wouldn't change anything about you
I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man
I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man


It was a pretty good performance
Yesterday out on the street
Maybe they should give me an Emmy or an Oscar
Cause you didn't suspect a thing
We made small talk on the sidewalk
I even laughed out loud
And I didn't blink an eye when I told you that I'm happy now
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
Truth is I've had a lot of practice
I've put on this show before
Just like the day you told me we were history
I was brilliant standing right outside your door
I convinced you and me too
It was gonna be all right
That we'd both be better off that I would get on with my life
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
It's time I came clean
It's time I told the truth
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you
Baby I'm still in love with you
Yeah
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Baby my heart's on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
Yeah I'm a good liar


Your daddy wouldn't like it if he knew what
I was thinking right now
But the way you look this evening girl it's hard to keep
Your feet on the ground
It's raining outside
Let's start a fire
Baby I say we just stay in tonight
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
It's almost like the DJ's playing every song especially for us
And it takes me back to that summer night when you and me
Learned everything about love
I just wanna hold
Your body close girl I don't wanna ever let go
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
It's almost like the DJ's playing every song especially for us
I wanna feel your heart beat all night long
When you whisper in my ear, girl it's sweeter than
My favorite song
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around baby
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
Let's dance to the radio


If I could do it all again
I'd look more in the mirror
Instead of finding someone else to blame
If I could do it all again
I'd do a lot more praying
Less cussing 'bout the things that I can't change
I'd laugh a little louder
Sing more in the shower
Care a little less if I'm in tune
Concentrate on who I am not who I might have been
If I could do it all again
If I could do it all again
I'd take it a little slower
Make a few more memories I could keep
I'd crawl in bed beside my wife and just lay down and watch her
Soaking up her beauty while she sleeps
I'd work less hours
I'd buy her more flowers
Make more love on rainy afternoons
Overlook my little faults and not my little sins
If I could do it all again
I'd walk a little taller
Talk a little smaller
Love the way my maker meant me to
I might make less money but I'd make a better friend
If I could do it all again
If I could do it all again


Your down on your luck.
You just lost your truck.
You cant afford another beer.
Your credit cards don’t work.
Whole world thinks you’re a jerk.
You wondering how you wound up here.
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
Now your sleeping on the couch at your best friends house watching Colombo
Eating cold pizza in your underwear
Just remember I told ya so
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
So if you’re thinking about saying adios
Well, take it from the fool who knows
She’s gonna serve ya papers make ya pay through the nose and when her lawyer gets through with you you’ll have to move to Mexico.
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats living with an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around


I used to think I was a bigshot
Thought I had it all but guess what
Can't measure life by the things you got
In the end it all ends up to nothing
I swear I missed so many birthdays
Valentines, hallowe'ens and anniversaries
Left me lonesome in the worst ways
But mister I learned something[Chorus:]
You can't buy back the moments that matter
You can't buy back the moments that matter
There's a big pot of gold at the top of the ladder
But you can't buy back the moments that matter
Gonna play some football in the backyard
Teach my nephew how to play the guitar
Call up some old friends and play some cards
Waste a few Saturday evenings
Gonna take my wife out dancing
Every now and then without her asking
Spin her around singing and laughing
There's memories we should be making[Chorus]
All this talk about the good life
Makes me realize I got a great life
Gotta keep my priorities in sight
You just get one time around[Chorus]
You can't buy back the moments that matter
You can't buy back the moments that matter
Years pass you buy and the days start to scatter
But you can't buy back the moments that matter


I was watching the news tonight
Anchorman said there was a fight
And a young man died from his wounds
They showed pictures of the battle
And I almost turned the channel
Like I always seem to do
Then it hit me like a freight train coming through
That’s somebody’s son,
Somebody’s husband,
Somebody’s everything,
Out there someone’s coming undone
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebody’s son
I walked down the hall to check
On my youngest lying in bed
And I stood there watching him dream
I tried but I couldn’t imagine how we would feel if something happened
And I didn’t have him here with me
Then I cried for that dead boy and his family
He’s somebody’s son,
Somebody’s husband,
Somebody’s everything,
Out there someone’s coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
He’s somebody’s son
Somebody’s son,
Somebody’s husband,
Somebody’s everything.
Out there someone’s coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebody's son


Let me pour you a tall one,
Come sit down next to me.
Baby you look so good,
In those faded jeans.
I've been stoned cold sober,
You've been cold as ice.
I got a good idea,
Let's get drunk and fight![CHORUS:]
Let's get drunk and fight,
Keep the neighbors up all night.
You can scream at me,
And I'll make you cry.
And when the morning comes,
We'll make some make-up love,
While we apologize.
But tonight,let's get drunk and fight!
Have another pina colada
And get good and torqued down
If you need a pinata
You can kick me around!
You can insult my mother
And I'll question your past.
It turns me on when you're pissed off
Cuz, you look hot when you're mad.[chorus x2]
Baby tonight,
Let's get drunk & fight!


Baby let your hair fall down around me
Let me feel your body close right next to me
There's something about the way you look into my eyes
That let's me know that you wear no disguise[Chorus]
When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love
Baby you broke the chains around this heart
You made this jaded man put down his guard
And I don't know all the words to say how I feel inside
Baby let me show you tonight[Chorus]
When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love
Baby hold on tight, don't ever let go
I wanna feel you in my arms and my soul
Baby, baby, baby
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love


When I was a kid I had it made in the shade
Couple girlfriends and a Chevrolet
Oh how I long for those days
When all I needed was a couple of bucks
Just enough to put some gas in my truck
Buy a six pack of beer and get a weird haircut[Chorus]
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I grew up so they say
Got a real job and and IRA
A mortgage on this house
I can barely pay
A blackberry and a cellphone
I spend more time at work
Then I do at home
Somebody please tell me where I went wrong[Chorus]
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
I know nothing stays the same
But I feel like I'm dancing
Way too close to the flame[Chorus]
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Yeah I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off


Jamie's a highschool teacher
She wakes up every morning at the crack of dawn
And puts the coffee on
Gives her lectures, grades those papers
The Work ain't done when the last one's gone
She don't do it for the paycheck
Anything at all would pay the bills
Even on days her life's a train wreck
But she still loves those kids[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you
Joe's a highway worker
I saw him today when I drove by and the sun was hot
100 degrees on that blacktop sweatin'
He's out there working just getting by
He breaks his back to keep his family fed
It's all that matters much to him
Tomorrow morning he'll roll out of bed
Do it all again[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you
There ain't no hall of fame
Probably never know your name
They're everywhere around us
They're stories all the same
So here's to the cop that works the midnight beat
Here's to the maid who cleans the hotel sheets
Here's to the farmer harvestin' the fields
Here's to the trucking haulin' 18 wheels
Here's to the workers on the assembly line
The secretary, the firemen, and the men down in the mines
Here's to everyone who does their part
I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you


I knew it would happen someday
But I never thought that it'd be tonight
Then you walked into the bar
With your new Mr.Right
With that big ol'chip on my shoulder
And Johnny Walker making me see red
I decided I'd walk right on over
And pour him a beer, on his head[Chorus]
And I know I'll regret this tomorrow
It's just another cross that I'll have to bear
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
I know it's not my proudest moment
But when he swung at my face and just missed
I decided there and then I'd introduce his chin
To my right fist
Then I tipped my hat to my ex-girlfriend
Said "Darlin' you should look nice
For a low down cheatin' dead beatin'
Cold hearted witch, ruin my life[Chorus]
And I know I'll regret this tomorrow
It's just another cross that I'll have to bear
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
Yeah I know I'll regret this tomorrow
Cause Mr. Right's finally coming up for air
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
I know I'll regret this tomorrow
Instead of leavin' I sat back in my chair
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care


Skimpy bikinis and bear skin
It's always good to see them out again
Cabin fever, grey skies
Six months of winter finally waved goodbye
Sometimes this world seems cold as ice[Chorus]
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
Where all your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Sometimes it's summertime
Grab a cooler, a 12 pack
I'll rub some lotion up and down your back
Flip flop living, stress free
Nothing to do we got no where to be
Come on baby drift away with me[Chorus]
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
Where all your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Sometimes it's summertime[Chorus]
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
All your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Nothing but peace of mind
Leave all your cares behind
Sometimes it's summertime
Sometimes it's summertime


Well I've seen the sunset from the top of a mountain
And I've walked the streets of Katmandu
I've seen a sky so full of stars, I couldn't count them
But I ain't never seen nothing like you
I've felt forgiveness looking out over the ocean
I've been lonely in a cheap motel
I've felt love as gently brush against my skin
But I've never felt nothing like you[Chorus]
You, you're too beautiful for words
You, you move me so much it hurts
Never had something I was so afraid to lose
I never had nothing like you
Well I would give away all of my tomorrows
Let my soul turn black and blue
Just to spend one night lost in your arms
Cause I ain't never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you


There's no frost on the windows,
It's always eighty degrees,
Everybody is beautiful
and there is always an ocean breeze.
They got palm trees and white sand,
Moviestars and Malibu,
Got everything that a man could want
Well everything but you.[Chorus:]
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warmer
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.
I bet back home its snowed,
You're good and warm in your bed.
I wonder if you miss me,
Cause I just can't get you out of my head.
I haven't seen you in so long,
But I still feel you so strong.
This place looks so right,
But feels so wrong.[Chorus:]
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warm
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.
Three in the morning
And I can't sleep,
And if I could you'd be in my dreams.
Laying here without you I'm not me[Chorus:]
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warm
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.
That's the trouble with California.
That's the trouble with California,
You're not here.


There’s no place I’d rather be
Than on this blanket here with you
Watching that big red sunset
Into a Caribbean blue
We’re sure it’s hot down here
Or maybe it’s just you
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Let’s let the ocean waves
Gently serenade us
With a sexy island song
There’s no one around
And you keep turning me on and on and on
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Well I’m glad we stole that bottle
From a hotel tiki bar
And I’m glad the moon ain’t out tonight
So we can hide out in the dark
Let’s show off our tan lines
To that endless sea of stars
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Let’s let the ocean waves
Gently serenade us
With a sexy island song
There’s no one around
And you keep turning me on and on and on
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong[Instr.]
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
By tomorrow morning
Baby we’ll be boarding
That plane and flyin’ home
There’s no one around
God you’re turning me on and on and on
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong


Well I don't drive through the night these days
It's just not a chance I'm willing to take
And I don't spend my money foolishly
Cause there's important things that you're gonna need
You already got a hold on me
And I haven't even heard you cry
I haven't even looked into your eyes
I haven't held you one time but you've changed my life
And I don't even know your name
But I know I'll never be the same
Oh I can't wait to show you you can fly
And I haven't even heard you cry
You might look like your mom, you might look like me
I don't really care as long as you're healthy
And I'll make mistakes there's no doubt
But loves one thing you won't live without
Cause you own a place in my heart now
And I haven't even heard you cry
I haven't even looked into your eyes
I haven't held you one time but you've changed my life
And I don't even know your name
But I know I'll never be the same
Oh I can't wait to show you you can fly
And I haven't even heard you cry
Well I don't even know your name
But I know I'll never be the same
Oh I can't wait to show you you can fly
I'm thinking about first steps and bike rides
And I haven't even heard you cry


There’s a calendar hanging in the kitchen,
Today I’m taking it down I’m tired of living
Like tomorrow can’t get here fast enough.
Took a while but I’m finally learning
To make the most of each moment I’m given
Instead of waiting on better days to come.
No more wishing my life away.
These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I won’t look ahead,
I won’t look back.
I’m gonna live,
I’m gonna laugh.
Well I won’t let another second waste,
These are those days.
It’s been awhile since I’ve called up my mother
Just for the sake of saying I love her,
Ain’t gonna wait around till it’s too late.
I’ve always wanted to see the Grand Canyon.
Its time I stopped talking and just start planning.
No more excuses no more saying someday, someday.
No more dreaming my life away.
These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I won’t look ahead,
I won’t look back.
I’m gonna live,
I’m gonna laugh.
Well I won’t let another second waste,
These are those days.
These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I won’t look ahead,
I won’t look back.
I’m gonna live,
I’m gonna laugh.
Well I won’t let another second waste,
No, I won’t let another second waste.
These are those days.
(This is my life, the time is now to get things right.)
These are those days.
(I won’t look back, I’m gonna live I’m gonna laugh.)
Don’t wanna waste my life away,
These are those days.


If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live
Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
But I... Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy


There's no need for you to worry about anything
Who can say what the future gonna bring
But if you worry about tomorrow
It will only bring you sorrow
Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine
Hold your head up high
Face the future with a smile
Things'll be better
It just takes a little while
So when your feelin' low, down and out
You're gonna shine without a doubt
Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine
Life is just what you make it
Can be good or can be bad
How can you miss something you never had
When things go wrong don't forget
There's no need for you to get upset
Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine
It's gonna be alright


(Lee diamond, george davis)
It was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
You've beat me to the girl that I always wanted
You thought you had her brother but you still don't own her because I'm not through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride
I know that it's a fact that you sneak behind my back
Smiled in my face and deceived me with your lies, but I'm not through
Oh, there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride
But this is the part that you knew nothing of
She confessed to me that she toyed with your love
You were just a game, that she loved to play
You never had her
She took you for a ride
All of her ecstasy that you had
Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
You had her brother, you were my guest
You pawned your broken heart just like all the rest
And now you are through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride
Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
She took you for a ride


I play the game of the modern romeo but never in my life did I see
A woman as square as a pool table and twice as green
I gave you all of my money and all of my loving too
But now you're goin' around just a telling everybody that I made a fool of you
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
I ask the man from up above, help me to save your love
I want you
You're a hard nut to crack
You take a strong man and break his back
I don't know but I've been told, next to you my life's been cold
You're a demon, girl, you know you're outta sight
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
Ask the man from up above, help me to save your love
I want you
Know the guy you're giving my money
And you come home and call me honey
You look like you made a resolution, took my best friend john and put him in an institution
You're a demon, girl you know you're outta sight
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
I ask the man from up above to help me to save your love
I want you
You're a hard nut to crack


You think you're so smart
Yes, you think you know it all
But the game you're trying to play
Can be played another way
And you see that, you never never had it so good 'till you met me
I brought you to the city
Now you tell me, there's no room for pity
My friends tried to tell me so
I told them they didn't know
That lights have gone to your head
You never never had it so good 'till you met, until you met me, oh until you met me
No you never, you never, you never had it so good


Too many, too many mornings,
Gotta wake up soon
Too many, too many mornings,
Whoa Lord gotta wake up soon
Oh and eat my breakfast by the light of the moon
It was late, very late last summer,
When I first got my time
Whoa it was late, very very late last summer
You know when I, I first got my time
My buddy got one hundred years,
Thank the Lord I just got ninety-nine
If you see, if you see my mama,
Won't you tell her this for me
Lord, if you see, if you see my dear old mother,
Won't you please tell her this for me
I got a long long time
And Lord knows when I'm gonna be free
You know they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin'
But you know that they won't last long
Lord, they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin',
But you know that they won't last long
One day they're gonna wish they were a baby boy
In their mothers arms
You know they're always, always talking
About dangerous blue
Whoa, you know they're always talking
About dangerous blue
If I had my big old pistol,
You know I'd be dangerous too
Twelve jury men found me guilty,
The doorman looked me up and down
Lord, twelve jury men found me guilty,
You know the doorman looked me up and down
Just looked at me through the corner of his eye and said
Boy, you're penitentiary bound
One day, one day down in New Orleans,
All the girls gonna jump and shout
Lord, one day down in New Orleans
All the girls gonna jump and shout
When them big green gates open up wide,
I'll come steppin' out


You said he was just an old acquaintance that you knew a long time ago
I could tell when he held you in his arms, you seemed spellbound by his charms
No need to try, you can't deny, that look in your eyes spelled love, love, love, love
L o v e, l o v e, l o v e was all I saw, it was love, love, love, love
And I used to call you on the telephone
And I thought, I thought it very funny why you were never home
And I used to believe that I could trust you
But I find that you untrue
Lately, lately I find that I'm all by myself
Thinking you love me, when it's someone else
Hats off, hats off to you and your new lover
'Cause for me, 'cause for me there will be no other
Girl, to take your place, with tears on my face
Farewell to you, may God bless and keep you
Please dear lord keep her safe for me
Farewell, farewell my darlin', my darlin', my darlin
Whoa I need you, I need you, I need you


Since you're gone with your guy
I feel as though I want cry
But a man ant supposed to shed a tear
If only you were here (you've gone away baby), if only you were here (you've gone away baby)
If only if you were here I'd lie for you, darling I'd die for you
Please say you're coming home
Since you've gone away
Been working hard while you're at play
Never thinking that you are untrue
Didn't worry over you
So long, this is goodbye
I didn't want you to leave me, but I've got my pride
There's one thing I want you to know
Girl I love you so (you've gone away baby), girl I love you so (you've gone away baby)
You've gone away (you've gone away baby)
So long (you've gone away baby)
Oh my darling, so long


Hey la, um de hey oh la
Said, hey la, um de hey oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Said hey, oh hey, feelin' good today
One day as I was a havin' myself a party
You know a flyin' saucer landed right by my side
You know a big green man jumped out and boy you know he robbed me
You know he beat me for my bottle before I got high
I hittim' up knowing that I was dead
'Cause he had that big ray-gun pointed at my head
But curiosity will get the best of the best
You know he smelled that bottle and the liquor did the rest
And I said, hey la, um de hey oh la
Hey la, um de hey oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey, oh hey, it ain't over yet
Turned that bottle up and started drinking
It was a long, long time before he pulled it away
His eyes got crossed and man his knees started wobblin'
He took four steps forward and this is what he said
He said, hey la, um de hey, oh la
Hey la, um de hey, oh le
He said hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey oh la, feel good today
I could see this cat was a just about to party
'Cause he had that great big green in his eye
He said come on hurry on down, let's forget our troubles
Just jump in my space hot-rod and take a little ride
So now I'm not afraid of no kind of space man
'Cause I keep my defenses by my side
And if you ever see me any place or any time
You can bet I'm a holding my bottle by my side
And I'm gonna sing hey la, um de hey, oh la
Hey la, um de hey, oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey oh hey, I feel good today

For that's what love will do
Darling, I'm so surprised,
Oh, when I first realized
That you were fooling me
Darling, they say that our love won't grow
I just want to tell them that they don't know
For as long as you, long as you are loving me
Our love will grow wider, deeper than any sea
And all the things in the world, in this whole wide world
Is just that you would say that you'd be my girl

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely, they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?

You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand beneath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh, I know that the music's fine like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Baby, don't you know I love you so
Oh, can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
Oh, I love you, oh, so much
You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on till the night is gone, and it's time to go
(You can dance, you can dance)
If he asks (You can dance)
If you're all alone (You can dance)
Can he take you home (You can dance)
You must tell him no (You can dance)
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' (save) save the last dance for me

There'll be some flowers bringin'
Gonna be some sad singin'
Over you, I say over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

People peepin' from their window screens
Parade of cars with their headlights on
All of that will be goin' on
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby

For you baby to take your sleep
Into a pine box an' down you'll go
Where you will stay where it's free of snow
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through
All your folks will be dressed in black
Ride a long black cadillac

Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through
Say I want to slay you baby, whoa now

Even though we're apart you're still right here in my heart 
Your hands are still in mine, I can still hear you whispering words divine 
I can feel your warm embrace, just the thought of it puts a smile upon my face 
But my imagination, whoa I said it's so strong, but reality keep assuring me I'm all alone 
But now from my lips comes a song, with tears in my eyes, 
Cuz now you're gone, so all your sweet talk........ 
Even though we're apart, you're still right here in my heart 
My imagination, Oh I said it's so strong, but reality keeps assuring me that I'm all alone 
My imagination, Oh so strong, but reality keeps assuring me that I'm all alone

(hey little Alice, hey little Alice)
I know a little girl lives down the street (hey little Alice)
She's a rockin' little mama, and she sure is sweet (hey little Alice)
She comes out early with the rising sun (hey little Alice)
She comes back in the evening when the day is done (hey little Alice)
Night time comes and she's out again (hey little Alice)
Well this time, this is where the fun begins (hey little Alice)
Down at the corner there's a local dance (hey little Alice)
Every weekend there's a local band (hey little Alice)
Featuring nothing but rock and roll (hey little Alice)
Alice wouldn't miss this to save her soul (hey little Alice)
(hey little Alice, hey little Alice)
I went to the corner and walked in the door (hey little Alice)
Alice as usual had took the floor (hey little Alice)
Like the girl with the red dress on (hey little Alice)
She could shake that thing all night long (hey little Alice)
Right behind me I heard some people say (hey little Alice)
She never quits until the band stops playing (hey little Alice)
(hey little Alice, hey little Alice)
I'm talking about Alice now, you know she's alright (hey little Alice)
I said she's alright now, I said she's my girl (hey little Alice)
I'm talking about Alice now, I'm talking about Alice now
Oh yeah now, I said come on, come on


Every time the telephone rings I hold my breath
Hoping that it's you, I'm scared to death
Phone went ring, my crippled heart cried
Let it be you, on the line
Then a voice say hello, can I speak to joe? 
Wrong number, I'm sorry, good bye
Pity the fool who loves you so
If you found someone new, don't let me know
The phone rang once again, my heart skipped a beat
Must be you, this is my belief
Then the voice on the other end say can I speak to ben? 
Wrong number, I'm sorry, good bye
I live simply on the memory
Of your love that was once for me
Come back my darling please
And set my heart at ease
Then a voice say hello, darling you know I love you so
Hold on baby, 'til I tell these blues good bye
'til I tell these blues good bye


[take 14: "jesus h. christ", 2-3-4]
There's a new girl in my neighborhood
She's a sweet little thing, she looks real good
She gets everybody's attention around
They call her sweet little mama
All the boys wink when they see her
Even the girls smile when they meet her
Everybody's trying to be first
To hold sweet little mama
She got a certain secret in her smile
That makes you wanna stay awhile
But the minute you get too close
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry
Stop by my house and you can't miss her
This little girl is my little sister
She's about 9 days old
They call her sweet little mama
Say she got a certain secret in her smile
That makes you wanna stay awhile
The minute you get too close
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry
Stop by my house, you can't miss her
This little girl is my little sister
Well, she's about 9 days old
They call her sweet little mama


Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
I'll not say my last good bye
Whoa, so don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
'cause I'll return someday
So don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' no, no don't weep
My heart tells me you're in love with me
Whoa, so don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' don't weep
'cause I'll return someday soon
(to take you in my arms) and to squeeze you tight
(to capture all your charms) every, every, every day now
Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' no don't cry
I'm not saying my last good bye
Whoa, no don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
I'll return someday, someday soon (someday soon)
Whoa, don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't, don't you cry
'cause I'm not saying my last good bye
Whoa, don't cry, no, no, no, don't cry


Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Oh why she's never on time
She should have been here since a quarter 'til nine
What could be keeping her so long
Well is she in another mans arms
Do we still have our date
I won't know until it's too late
Could be my bad luck
Maybe she done stood me up
She thinks that I'm lame
The way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Oh why, she haven't got here yet
She's the meanest girl I've ever met
Could she still be at home
I think I'll try to call her on the phone
Her mother answered the phone
And said that she had already gone
I should let her go
But oh, I love her so
She thinks that I'm lame
But the way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Oh why she's never on time
She should have been here since a quarter 'til nine
What could be keeping her so long
Oh, is she in another mans arms
Do we still have our date
I won't know until it's too late
Could be my bad luck
Maybe she done stood me up
She thinks that I'm lame
The way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane


For every boy, there's a girl
And I know somewhere in this world
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me, for me
I pray at night alone in my sleep
That someday my lover I'll meet
'cause I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
There must be somebody for me, for me
I pray at night that you'll come back to me
I love you with all my heart and soul
Darling, I would never make you cry
I want you to come to my side
For every boy there's a girl
And I know somewhere in this world
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me, for me
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me


Train whistle blowin' around the bend
But I can hear it comin' in
That's the train my baby's on
But now she's gonna bring her home
Got a letter yesterday
This is what she had to say
Meet me at the station a quarter to ten
Let's try it over again
Waitin' at the station happy as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My lonely nights are over from this day on
Since my baby's coming back home
The train pulled in a few minutes late
But I didn't mind that little wait
That train is carrying medicine for heartaches and pain
For this lonely man
Everybody's gettin' off one by one
Tellin' their friend where they've been and what they've done
But where is my girl, everybody's off the train
She made a fool of me again
Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby, now
My nights will still be lonely on and on
Since my baby didn't come home
Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My nights will still be lonely, on and on
Since my baby didn't come home
Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My nights will still be lonely, on and on
Since my baby didn't come home


Once again, 
Here am I wrapped up in a dream, I'm about to lose my mind 
Over you, I've done it again 
Once again, 
I sit alone wondering and worrying all night long 
Over you, I've done it again 
I've been in love before 
I've been hurt before 
I thought I was through with being a fool 
But I ended in the same shoes once more 
Once again, 
I sit alone wondering and worrying all night long 
Over you, I've done it again 
I've done it again 
You know, I know I've done it again 
Over you, I've done it again


Why torture yourself, when you know you're in love
Throw your pride in the ocean and be happy beneath the stars above
Confess your feelings to the one's you love
And let's live, before it's too late
Let's live
Why deprive yourself, of the wonders of life
Time is getting shorter, there's no reason for those lonely nights
If you don't, if you don't love me, you'll miss the boat
And let's live, before it's too late
Let's live
Why should you live in a sad state of mind
Problems, problems, problems all the time
Do your best to get them off your chest
Everything, everything will be just fine
Love is nice , love is sometimes cruel
When you've been in love you have been to the greatest school
So try and make an "a" honey, and I'll do the same
Let's live, before it's too late
Let's live, before it's too late
You know, I know, before it's too late
So, come on, come on, come on
Let's live


What has happened down here
Is the winds have changed
Clouds roll in from the north
And it started to rain
It rained real hard, and
It rained for a real long time
Six feet of water
In the streets of Evangeline
The river rose all day
The river rose all night
Some people got lost in the flood
Some people got away alright
The river had busted through
Clear down to Plaquemine
Six feet of water
In the streets of Evangeline
Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
Oh Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
President Coolidge come down
In a railroad train
With his little fat man
With a note pad in his hand
President says "little fat man
Oh isn't it a shame
What the river has done
To this poor farmer's land"
Oh Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
You're trying to wash us away
Oh Louisiana, oh Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
Oh Lord, they're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away


Ok, so your heart is broken 
You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin' 
You say you even think about dying 
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, dig this 
Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 
Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do 
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you 
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be 
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion 
Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 
How can you help it, when the music starts to play 
And your ability to reason, is swept away 
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality 
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you 
Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime 
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby 
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again, 
Everybody plays the fool 
Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 
Every plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I wanna say it again 
Everybody plays the fool


Down here the river meets the sea
In the sticky heat I feel you open up to me
Love comes out of no where, baby, oh, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Lying underneath the stars right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are, and how do you do, how do you do baby
Oh, the clouds roll in across the moon, and the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
We never gonna make that bridge tonight, baby
Set across the Pontchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Batten down the hatches, baby
Leave your heart out on your sleeve
Looks like we're in for stormy, stormy, stormy weather
That ain't no cause to leave
Just like
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Baby can you feel it, can you feel it
It feels like rain
Baby can you feel it, can you feel it
Feels like rain
Let your love, let your love come down
Oh, down on me


Must be a million girls in this great big city
I know that one of them is just right for me
I've looked uptown, downtown, all around searchin'
I know she's out there waiting for me
Somewhere, somebody, lookin', longin'
Somewhere, somebody, waitin' for me
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world can this girl be
You know street lights shine in those passin' faces
I keep tryin' to catch somebody's eye
But all the shoulda been's, the woulda been's, the mighta been's and the coulda been's
Slippin' away and just walk right on by
Somewhere, somebody, lookin', longin'
Somewhere, somebody, waitin' for me
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world can this girl be
I walk in the rain that's fallin'
Some voice in the distance callin', why
I run to the empty doorway waitin' for the sun to shine
When will love be mine
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world
Must be a million girls in this great big city
I know you're out there waiting for me


Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
If I got on my knees and pleaded with you
Not to go, but to stay in my heart
Would you walk out the door
Like you did once before
But this time be different and please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go
If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone with my tears
Knowing i, I need you so
Would you still turn and go
But this time be different in some way
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved by your kiss
If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone with my tears
Knowing i, I need you so
Would you still turn and go
But this time be different and please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay


With you in mind, things just ain't bad as they seem
With you in mind, I can fill my wildest dreams
With you in mind, I can do anything, I know I can
With you in mind
With you in mind
With you in mind, I went out looking for the best
With you in mind, cause you deserve nothing less
With you in mind, I've done so many things that love can bring
With you in mind
With you in mind
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
The same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day


With her mind far away from mine
She's mostly sincere most of the time
Yeah
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
With her strong desire to please
Oppression to her, is like a disease
Yeah
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
Many times when she's alone
She dreams and dreams and dreams
Dreaming of a perfect love
That never was, and would never be
With her heart placed in her hand
She will go to the end and back if she can for me
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
