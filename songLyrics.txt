Don't feel bad and don't look back, I don't feel bad
Shame on you, you hate everything thats new

You catch on years later, you're not even slow
Can't stay have a good time, now I've gotta go
I can't stay you're in the way, so listen when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me I might, when I'm talking

Makes you think I would when I'm talking
It's better than I write, remember every night
Say to me I might when I won't!

I've got to get up ma, and get in my place
I've got to work out ma, and sort out my face
I've got all 'zines telling me what to eat
And I'm tired of being told what to wear on my feet
And I don't have the time to get all worked up about the year on the street
And it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
There goes another day, I've been here too long
Do I have to change into what it takes, yeah make it No.1
I feel out of flavour, I don't look like a picture
You think I'm a loser, but I can see through you
You're running around like you're running the country
I know that you think that you've got one on me
Ear to the ground like a boy about town
Can't get nothing to fit me!
And it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
There goes another day, I've been here too long
Do I have to change in to what it takes, yeah make it No.1
Got to call for an old friend who used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Sold his house, sold his car
Bought a ticket to the West coast
Now he gives him 'em a stand-up routine in L.A.
yeah but it's not my fault, I can find my way, yeah it's not my fault
Got to look out for an old friend who used to be real close
Said it couldn't go on the American way
Sold his house, sold his car
Bought a ticket to the West coast
Now he gives 'em a stand-up routine in L.A.
Do I have to change in to what it takes, yeah make it No.1

Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
I think I'm trouble, there's always a couple
Around me wherever I go
They're out there to bug me
I don't think it's funny
Everybody's laughing at me yeah
I wanna go out, but there's no one about
All my friends want a quiet one at home
They're that same age as me
And their husbands to be yeah
Everybody in the building
Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long
I make a move here, and I make a move there
I've got millions of things on the go
I'll write me the best lines, they're too corny sometimes
Everybody's laughing at me
Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long

First stepped out of the aeroplane
I'd felt like I'd been here before
Took a ?? me down
Put a smile on my face
Felt like I could do more
How ace are buildings!
How big are the blocks
Reminds me of London, stuck in a graveyard
Six foot deep, bleaker street, no one lives out
People smile, never got the time
I look down I can not see the ground
A man who reads the news says there's no crime
There's no one around
There wasn't a sound
There's no one to arrest today
??
Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it
Don't ever what to go back
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96
-10, 1pm east village time
I laugh at your ?? you bought
Snow, snow, so we walk 70 blocks
On days like this nothing seems to far
Get in shot, I don't ask a lot
The weather was frozen, there wasn't a ??
Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it
Don't ever what to go back
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger
Whole place stops for the winter of '96
Maybe I could be here a long time
Much longer than I planned to stay
No telling when they'll get the airport open
No telling when i'll get way
Trying to tell us nothing's wrong
Trying to get the fire back on
Never lost a day of fun
Silence in the heightened mass of ??
How ace are buildings!
How big are the blocks
Reminds me of London, stuck in a gridlock


You're always fighting everyone
You were wroung when you were young
You love to think you're on the run
I had to laugh at all your jokes
Had to tremble 'cos you smoked
But you never ever get my vote, yeah!
You're the ones to run from, or so they say
I remember you back in the day
Did my best to keep out of the way
You kicked it up in school
Singing out of tune
While you're fighting everyone
I've been hanging in the sun
There's a million things I've done
You're the one who took the lead
Me least likely to succeed
Different now don't you agree
You're the ones to run from, or so they say
I remember you back in the day
Did my best to keep out of the way
You kicked it up in school
Singing out of tune
Thought you ruled the world
Singing out of tune
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
You're the ones to run from, or so they say
I remember you back in the day
Did my best to keep out of the way
You kicked it up in school
Singing out of tune
Everybody knew
Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune (a lot!)


I like the summer like you like your wife
Live in the "master" for the rest of my life
Every year since I was young
And always here and always fun
Distant places, staying faces
All I want, I understand is it's the summer
Over and over it's summer again
Fills up the sad hole in my head again
Several hours and passing faster
To lift their head down to the sand
Distant places, staying faces
All I want, I understand is it's the summer
And it's with it's flowers, and big huge skies
It gets high for hours, and then it dies
Ocean keeps me up all night
Sunshine makes my hair turn white
You know I hate the winter time
All because there's nothing quite like the summer
And it's with it's flowers, and breeses off shore
It gets high for hours, and then back for more
And it's with it's showers, and big big skies
It gets high for hours, and then it dies


And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
I find it funny, I laugh at people
And don't know why
I sometimes giggle, if there's an earthquake
Where good people die
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
I'll make the big man, I'll do what I can
I'll suffer for my sins
Speak with a deep voice, listen to metal
So that the good guys never win
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
Yeah you should see them all
When you sit in on Christmas day
But at six o' clock, on the sixth of June is OK
Got my life under the sun, pay for the things I've done
Pay for my mistakes
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here
House under the ground
House under the ground
House under the ground
And I'd have a house under the ground
All my friends would all come round
Laugh about the ones that got away
I wouldn't know the time of year
It's easier to tan down here


Yeah yeah yeah I've seen it all
Yeah yeah yeah I've heard it all
J.P wants to rock, not at five o'clock hes not
There's a medal in the kitchen for catching early worms
Yeah yeah yeah you're gonna bet
Yeah yeah you're gonna learn
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Stevie knows that it ain't dead
Yeah Farmer uncle still in bed
M.A.C. was born to rock, there's not a moment that he's not
"A" communication, illin' in my sleep
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I lost count of my sheep
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Never, never looking back, never falling off the track
Never clocking late for work, 'cause rocking pays the bills
So I don't need no education
I don't need any sleep
yeah yeah yeah yeah I never need to set my "series 3"
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know
Don't bother waking me at 5 in the morning
'Cause I don't want to know

Well we did this once before, and we're giving it some more
And it's OK to be as you are you know
It's always five on one and you notice when we're done
That nobody got hurt, you're the same as what you were you know
I've got something for starters, throw it up in the air
And I bet you don't care, we're getting louder
It sounds ok to me on the desk at ICP
Roll the tape 'cos we're rocking album two
And our manager don't mind, 'cos we put all that behind
We've got another bite and you know the time is right to rock for you
I've got something for starters, throw it up in the air
And I bet you don't care, we're getting louder
Hey, it's another day in "A"
I'm proud to be myself 'cause rock me this way
I've got plenty more to say, so let me clear my throat
Cause I'm not cool Britannia
Not getting any younger, they hate me in NME
I don't care where you've been
I don't care for your scene, you make me feel like an amputee
I've got something for starters, throw it up in the air
And I bet you don't care, we're getting loud


There's nothing real about your fight
There's nothing in the shit you write
You've got charisma in your hair
The make-up lady put in there.. and it's
One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? ((1+2+3+4)x(2+2+3+4)x(2x3)+(2+4) = 666)
Bring it on the Monkey Kong, it's just a name they got it wrong
Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong
You're the captain of the team
You're the new king of the scene
You hire a guy to keep you punk
Laugh it up 'cause you don't know you're sunk
And Its One, one plus two is three, can't we get along? ((1+2+3+4)x(2+2+3+4)x(2x3)+(2+4) = 666)
Bring it on the Monkey Kong, it's just a name they got it wrong
Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
How high can you try....
Every second every day, every minute that you waste
You're not everything you seem
Keep on fighting for the right, keep on rocking every night
That's exactly what I mean
It don't matter what you say, it won't change it anyway
You're not what you want to be
Every minute that you waste, when you're taking on the place
That's exactly what I mean
It's all gone wrong, they called it Monkey Kong


Hey we're gonna be around
Hey we're gonna work it out
Hey there's nothing to fight about
Today we're gonna be about
You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe that you want me to stay
You're hoping that I'll go away
I'm gonna be around
Hey I'm gonna work it out
Hey there's plenty to fight about
No way I'm ever going down
You hardly know me, you say I'm your best friend
Everything's ace, it'll work out in the end
Say that you love us, I don't believe that you want me to stay
You're hoping that I'll go away
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, you think that you own me
You don't think I see you, you don't think you know me
You can tell me all the things you want to say
'Cause I'll get better anyway
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
You think that I need you, you think that you own me
You don't think I see you, you don't think you know me
You follow me here, follow me there
You mess me around like you think that I care
Hey


I don't know I'm born, I'm only young
I don't have a choice, you know I'm only young
I'm getting older, I'm getting smaller
Everybody tells you, "you've got to walk taller"
You did a war, and now you're poor
And like your friends, you're gonna get it in the end
You've heard it all before, you can't go on much more
It's not like I think:
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Can't put it off, you put it on, don't ever stop, it doesn't last long
The younger folks they don't understand
Back in the day, you're gonna get it in the end
You've heard it all before, you can't go on much more
It's not like I think:
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Fall down for no reason, the churches are heaving
The old folks they live their lives
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Fall down for no reason, the churches are heaving
The old folks they live their lives
The old folks are losers, they can't work computers
They die in December time
Fall down for no reason, the churches are heaving
The old folks they live their lives[Backing for last 2 verses]
Same as everybody 
It's coming back to haunt me 
It's on all the time 
Sitting in the summer 
The days are getting longer 
They don't remember why 
A cost to everybody 
They're always sad and lonely 
They live their lives


I want to feel important, want to think I'm worth it
Still feeling lame in the end
Sit in, in the evening talking to my robots
Still feel the same in the end
Spend a little time, spend a bit more cash, makes you feel aright
Want to know the truth, I feel the same as you do
Wake up in the morning, be careful what you ask for
It's never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing, let 'em do the talking
It's never gonna do in the end
I want to have a girlfriend, want a bigger garden
Still feeling lame in the end
Move to California, sell a million albums
Still feel the same in the end
Everybody knows, better than you know, it makes 'em feel alright
Want to know the truth, feel the same as you do
Wake up in the morning, be careful what you ask for
It's never gonna do in the end
The telephone is ringing, let 'em do the talking
It's never gonna do in the end[Answering Machine Message]
Wake up in the morning, be careful what you ask for

It's summer on the underground
So much sweat a man could drown
There's a panic on the overland
And London Bridge is falling down
The temperature is 92
It's baking in the vocal booth
All the tourists come in June
There's so many you can't move
There's people getting rich today
There's people that they've got to pay
There's lots of places I could go
We should be rocking in the studio
Don't feel like working today, I feel like getting away
Don't feel like driving today, I feel like getting away
Dalston is a wicked place
At weekends it gets off its face
And everybody calls you mate
But do they really want to know?
The drinks machine is running out
And please don't use that ticket touts
The ladies have it all on show
We should be rocking in the studio
Don't feel like working today, I feel like getting away
Don't feel like driving today, I feel like getting away
On my feet for a week thinking nobody cares
And I can't get to sleep thinking nobody shares
Are you taking to me? Get out of the way
We walk on the left and good manners are free
You don't have to pay
You know you just can't see, everything in a day,
Yeah I'm talking to you! Me? Yeah yeah I know
Back Here On The Underground
Back Here On The Underground

It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go
Save it for the Jury, 'cause I don't care anymore
You're not even worthy
It's a warning, that's as far as we go
Warning, that's as far as we go
I don't even know you, I don't even want to know
'Cause I think you're mental
It's a warning, that's as far as we go 
Warning, that's as far as we go

Coming back at you, record number two, what a way to start the day
Thinking big enough, with a stronger look
Got no back up plan in case we blow it
It's all the same old stuff, they think it's good enough
"It works" and nobody gets hurt
It happens every time, like anybody minds
They're telling me, "it's just the way it works"
Too much work to do, rocking new improved, keep it in the family
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It ain't broke so fix it anyway
Got a second chance and a fresh advance, what a way to start the week
Sack the formula, there's no need to bother
Got no backup plan, so let's not blow it up
It's all the same old stuff, they think it's good enough
"It works" and nobody gets hurt
It happens every time, like anybody minds
They're telling me, "it's just the way it works"
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway
It ain't broke so fix it anyway
Fix it anyway


Four long years ago, searching for the snow
We found the Tahoe lakes, just about the perfect place
50 Runs at 'Heavenly', and the nights at 'Squaw Valley'
Yeah, the trees are pretty wide, "That's where Sonny bono died"
All is quiet on New Years day, think I'll try and impress my mates
So I jump into the lake, I won't do that again, here we go again....
The south shore has the lot, and last month Dave Lee Roth did a solo spot
And some German bloke got shot, every year we say the same
"Try somewhere different for a change", but we jump on to the plane
Yeah, here we go again

Alright There Jason....theres somebody on the telly... on 15 to 1 right now, called Adam

Buy a junk?, delay that moon?, you think we feel the need to prove
That we play the fucking tunes, while you're the one that's fucking you
Now if you'd ever spared a day, at these things that don't fucking go away
You can see that our contract says that we get to do this our own way
Who can't challenge what you do? Don't be punks!
Who can't challenge where to go? Don't be punks!
And when will we change our tune? Don't be punks!
You can't tell 'em when and much! Don't be punks!
At this point you fucking loser, you don't have a fucking opinion


I'm down on the floor, there's a man at the door
He won't let me in 'cause he thinks he's the law
He'll give me a shout when he's figured it out
Gotta pick myself up, what am I waiting for?
It's never enough, yeah it's never too late
I reminded myself that I'm starting again
You're telling me "never", it should be "whenever"
And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time
Why can't I be just like the people that I know?
I've got what it takes, I'm bang up to date
You know how it is, I'm all over the place
Kicked in the face, I'm backstage, everyone here is half of my age
Standing in line, I'm hitching a ride
I'll give it a try but I don't have the time
You're telling me "never", it should be "whenever"
And when the world is swinging, I feel like I don't fit in
Don't even know the way, don't hear a word they say
And all the money making, I just want to have a go, I'm always up on time

Pretty scary how they know you, it depends who you talk to
From the end to the beginning, only happy when we're singing
Smiling for the camera, crazy silly monsters, they think everything is great
Black and white not colour, eight times ten, no bigger, not tonight it ain't
You can try and put the face on, you can talk but it all goes wrong
You can put it in an album, like the "90's never happened"
Everything is easy, but they don't believe me, I think I deserve a say
Beds are made for sharing, but I'm way past caring, not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't[Break]
Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't

Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't
Trying to remember, nothing lasts forever, live it before it gets too late
On the never ever, pretty good together, not tonight it aint


Your Miles Away
I'm Not messing about, got a mile of self doubt
Yeah, you're not even close, yeah
Because you're miles away
Another day in bed, sorting out your head
You don't know what you're talking about
You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
It's far from funny when you're falling over
Yeah, the robot voice, and the peoples choice
Yeah you blink and it goes wrong
Because you're miles away
You're not even warm, human after all
You don't know what you're talking about
You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
So far from funny when you're falling over
I'm too skint to pay my debtors, uh-oh un-opened letters
Feels like a siege I'm under, how did you get my number?
Oh-oh it's for the better, than on the never ever
I'll get back and back and back and back and back, around we go
You're not right all of the time
It's funny when you're wrong
You're miles away, no-one can stop me
So far from funny when you're falling over
Miles away, no-one can stop me
It's far from funny when you're falling over [x4]


All your friends are famous, you're the man at pulling favours
Is that the best that you could do? Is that the best we can do?
You say it before, and say it again
"You're gonna be massive it's a matter of when"
Is that the best we could do? Do we owe it all to you?
You're getting around, you're getting me down
It's not that you're used to failure, you put the hours in the cheques come later
That's the best that you can do? It's time to take on something new?
You're moving in circles, you're all over LA
You're big with the ladies, so they don't think you're gay
Is that the best you could do? And do we owe it all to you?
You're getting around, you're getting me down
You're getting around, you're getting me down
And when it don't work out, you put them on the stand
Its not you're fault you got them eating from your hand
You say the words, and everybody leaves (I'm not "your boy" and that's not the point)
You change your hair, you fully rock a weave
You don't make sense and you don't want to know
You're self defensive, oh-uh
You're getting me down, you're getting around
You're getting me down, you're getting around
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?
You're getting around, you're getting me down [x28]


Nothing
And nothing's where you're at
When you ain't got something
You'll never get it back
It's coming on like a drug
The universal power of one
But it don't mean nothing
If it all comes undone (uh-huh)
Fly away
If you fly away
You might die today
If you fly
Fly
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
You're left with nothing
And nothing's what you've got
When you ain't got no-one, no-one
You could have had the lot
And if it's over today
You'll never get that thing you had together, no way
You only get it once
Fly away
If you fly, If you fly
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing
Gimme some love
Gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
We ain't got nothing
A day's a number
Don't remember how you found it
You will never feel the same
And forever have to take
It for granted, don't remember our mistake
We ain't got nothing
A day's a number
Don't remember how you found it
You will never feel the same
And forever have to take
It for granted, don't remember our mistake
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing
Gimme some love
So gimme some skin
If we ain't got that then we ain't got much
And we ain't got nothing, nothing


Somethings going on
I don't know what I did
But it worked out fine again 
Got you in my song
It sounds like a hit
It's gonna be alright again
We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on
Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on
Nothing's going right
This could go on all night
Gotta raise my game again
You're the same as me
I fit you perfectly
I'll never be the same again
We're something to celebrate
The more you love, the more you hate
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on

Take some time to graduate
Take some time and don't be late
Who cares about us anyway?
Something's going on
Come on!
Something's going on
Oh yeah
Something's going on


6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio
The radioooo-oh 
Get out, get out, get out, yeah 
6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same?
There's a man with a gold band, but he's got his eye on mine
There a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time - at any time! 
When my knees don't work, I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's OK
The daylight is that way
We all go the same way 
6 O'12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone! 
Get out, get out, get out yeah
Get out, get out, get out! 
When my knees don't work, I start to shake
I won't panic, I won't hesitate
It's alright, it's OK
The daylight is that way
It's alright, it's OK 
6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train


Air on the streets, lights on the trees
Eight days a week, singer's disease
I wanna be where the sun meets the sky
I wanna be there, it's out of your mind
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna piece of the air when I breathe in
I wanna be the gold underneath the stream
Having my moment, you know what I mean 
Ooooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 
Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.
I wanna stay here and never go home again
I wanna be the grass underneath your feet
I wanna be the shops on your high street
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna be your alarm when you sleep in
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud 
Ooooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs 
Get a voice, don't get a doctor
That's your choice, no-one can stop you
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Got a job, I don't got no pension
In it for love - money's too tight to mention
I wanna be in the rockin'est city
I wanna do what I want if it kills me
Have to say, your home's where you make it
It's OK, I know when you fake it
I wanna be the gum on your train seat
I wanna stand up and walk on my own feet
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the rock underneath your ground
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one you can be around


Five pretty boys for ten shitty years
Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears
I need a reaction, a new revolution
All over the country, 'cos they took it away 
They took it away, it can't be impossible
They're playing the records that they play in hospital
Radio playlist for the terminally ill
You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill 
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away 
They took it away, left us with nothing
Second-hand hits and million misses
Nobody means it, they're making up stories
You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories 
I blame myself, I want an easy life
Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
I'm kicking myself for wasting it all 
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away 
They took it away, left us with nothing
You suffer the pain of your fingers burning
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day
Set the record straight - they took it all away


She's over it, she cannot take no more yeah
Don't wanna quit but that's a pretty nice door yeah
I got a bed, it really cost a fortune
I go away and it's too big without you
You've got it good, you know how good we've got it
You've got it bad, you know how bad we've got it 
I wouldn't swap it for a job in Starbucks
Wouldn't swap it for a job in Starbucks
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, I'll miss him when he's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is yeah
He works on automatic
Mr. Clean but i doubt it
He's got to have his say
Who needs him anyway?
Don't get your kind of music
He lets the others choose it
He thinks you kids are freaks
He wants you on the streets
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, I'll miss him when he's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is yeah
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, I'll miss him when he's gone
You don't know what it does to me
You don't know what it means to me
I take it as far as it goes
(I don't wanna know what I know)
It's too late to talk about it
I ain't changing any of it
Don't listen to us
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Don't want your job in Starbucks
Come on, you can have your own way
Come on, you can have your own say
So long, you miss it when it's gone
You don't know what it is, you don't know what it is yeah


Suck it up, we're going down
30 seconds 'till we smash into the ground
The passengers have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles 
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 
Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down, but then we just might
So this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 
Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care 
I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it, I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets - except I wish I'd took the train 
We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind 
I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays


So come out fighting, second's out
Who's the daddy? Well there's no doubt
Got one thing on your brain, you all act the same
But you're alright
'Cos you are from Venus and I am from Mars
You'd like your penis as big as your car
Not so good in the sack - so what, d'ya want your money back?!
Yeah, you're alright
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway
It's the way that you're scratching your balls when you walk
You wait till I'm watching the football - and then you talk!
You're never wrong, so bring it on
'Cos you're alright
'Cos I are from Venus and you am from Mars
You buy me panties that don't match my bras
Why so long in the bathroom? Baby I have to
Then it's alright
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway
Smacking you, whacking you, flat out attacking you
Beating you down with my words over you
You're too hot to handle - maybe you're mental
But you're alright
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
I bet you think you know the place
It's just as far as you can go, without going back again
Yeah, you know I'm right so shut yer face
You never listen anyway


It's OK to beat the living shit from the drum kit
It's OK to take what you don't have, if you want it 
That's alright, that's your way
Water's cold, December, Del Ray
Through those eyes, made me cry
And the summer is forever
It's the endless summer 
And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you
Remember what I told ya
The night in California
And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 
It's OK to leave your jacket on in the ocean
It's OK to sing the saddest song, Vibrations 
Thanks a lot, you can be
What you want, honestly
Magic days, golden nights
And the summer is forever
It's the endless summer 
And it's not about your girlfriend
And it's not about your boyfriend
And I'm not about to lose it over you
Remember what I told ya
The night in California
And I'm all about Pacific Ocean Blue 
I don't need no explanation
All I got is best intentions
I got fears, too much to mention 
You're not there, when I'm scared, terrified
Jump right in, the water's fine


We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! 
Running out of luck
Trying to keep it punk
You can only let yourself down
Afraid of what you know
A square shape in a round hole
You know, it goes in tight,
Goes in tight
We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become?
You're running out of time
You're never going nowhere
The best is all behind you
You're spending your cash like a man with no hands
Keepin' it real like your favourite bands
If they don't try
Then we don't buy, we don't buy
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up[SOLO!]
We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! Come on!
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
It's the distance, it's the distance
It's the distance, the position between me and you
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
Yeah, come on!
We go the distance till there's nowhere left to go
It's complicated, don't you hate what you've become? Oh yeah! Come on!
So stand up, so get up
So stand up, so get up
Stand up


I'm so tired, I need sleep
I'm talking to my pillow case, what's wrong with me?
I make mistakes, but them's the breaks
I'm crying out for anyone to come and rescue me 
Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 
Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it? 
Life's a bitch, and so am I
If you want it bad enough, there's lots of easy ways to die 
Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 
Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you cry about it?
Talk about a new wave (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!)
Talk about a way to save the day (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh!) 
Talk about a new world
Just not today 
Hey there, why you look so sad?
What made you so mad that you can't
You can't get over it
Hey there, why you look so hurt?
You get what you deserve, you know, here we go
Why don't you, why can't you
So tough when no-one knows you
No homies, so lonely
Why don't you cry about it now?


Right back at you, record three
Makes you wish that you were me
'Cos we got no job for life
Build 'em up like Frank Lloyd Wright
No two days turn out the same
Only sleeping on the plane
Not exactly Monkey days
C'mon, rock it up, from the back to the front, go! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 
Banshee wailing from my throat
Only dogs can hear the notes
Be myself to pay the bills
From L.A. to Skillmans Hill
We've done time for stealing shows
There ain't nothing we don't know
Plug us in and watch us go! 
C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 
Hot, like the desert sky
You're so cool on the inside
You hate being recognised
Going off on outside 
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs! 
Coming round for one more go
Way too loud for radio
Mosh pit full of casualties
OAP's get in for free
Time to even out the score
Thought we'd done enough before
Now we're kicking down your door 
Come on, rock it up, to the back
Measure twice, cut it once
Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on! 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, so come on 
So get your, so get your ears on
So get your, so get your ears on
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi
I'm serious, bring it on!


On and on like a Rush song, like a long one
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah the right one
There will come a day when Ill bury you
I will go the same way, together,
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough
Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming
Emo boy, naive and semi-functioning
Hey this is a love song, hands up if you feel it.
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
Don't say a word, that's not enough
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering
And the closest thing between us is air
And the moment that's between us is everything
Don't say a word, that's not enough


Run around, 
What's the frequency you're on? 
Get around, 
That's addiction you'll get some. 
Heart attack, 
Not as big as the next one. 
Pulling back, 
Things look different when you're young. 
Can't find a, good reason. 
Can't fight this way i'm feeling. 
These jealous, teenagers, 
That laugh at my behaviour. 
You'd be better off without me, 
Hate to see you sorry, 
Days are closing in, 
You're better off with him. 
Its boring but i'm making, 
Promises i'm breaking, 
Days are growing thin, 
You're better off with, 
Anyone, 
Makes no difference just pick one. 
Get around, 
What's the frequency you're on. 
You're scared around, 
Conversations you're never wrong. 
You're better off, 
New relations, 
You're better off,

You'd be better off without me, 
Hate to see you sorry,

You're better off with him. 
Its boring but i'm making, 
Promises i'm breaking, 
Days are growing thin, 
You're better off with, 
I can't take it anymore, 
I can't concentrate. 
You run around, 
In my brain, yeah you run around 
You're not having fun no more, 
There's a thousand ways. 
You get around, 
In my brain, yeah you get around. 
Run around, what's the frequency you're on? 
Get around, what's the frequency you're on?

There's an angel on the corner 
And they say she's watching over 
Over when we are under 
Fall asleep on the ground [Pre chorus:]
Hey 
Can you feel it calling your name 
Like a storm on a bone in the rain 
The pain now going you're not around [Chorus:]
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense 
I gotta rock another city 
I gotta break another country 
I'm gonna kick it til i'm 50 
Or i'm deep in the ground [Pre chorus:]
Hey 
Not another bone for the pain 
I'm never drinking again 
It don't make sense when you're not around [Chorus:]
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense [Solo]
There's a devil on the road [x3][Pre chorus:]
I can feel it call your name 
The feeling that's keeping me sane 
Wide awake when you're not around [Chorus:]
Wide awake for the night again 
Awake for the night again 
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer 
Gonna teach you the art of making sense

Lose yourself, save yourself. 
One more night, one more time. 
By yourself, no one else. 
One arrival time to hear you cry tonight. 
Pray today, slide away. 
And hide away, no one came. 
Holy graves, maiden names. 
Take a breath and hold it in and out again. 
And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. 
Take yourself, you hate yourself. 
Lie awake, wide awake. 
Bruise yourself, lose yourself. 
Pressure's on but not for long remind yourself. 
And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. 
Daylight's fading, angels waiting. 
Breaking all the plans we're making 
Daylight's fading, angels waiting. 
Breaking all the plans we're making 
And if you die, alone tonight. 
I'll be right, by your side. 
My advice, alone tonight. 
Wait a while save a life. [fade last 4 lines]

Dirty fingers, please believe us
Everybody dies
Guilty perfect, murder suspect
That was not your crime
You never do nothing
(Hey)
And that's all you do
(Hey)
You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
The weight has been hard on your back
You're wearing well out of respect
Slowly it's dragging you down
I'd never call it that
You're running away and you feel
The voices are way too loud
You never do nothing
(Hey)
And that's all you do
(Hey)
You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
I can be sorry for this
So give me the pain I will swallow it
I can be taller than this
So light up the way, I will grow with it
I can hail Mary's for this
So I can remain always positive
I can be smarter than this
And then I can be on my
Way, way, falling for it positively
Moment that I saw you in the way
Oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
You never do nothing and that's all you do
You never get lonely and nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you
Got no feeling, got no reason
Out of rhythm, feels like prison


Some days go on forever, 
Last long into the night, 
Some days feel like December, although its warm on the inside. 
Forget the middle of summer, 
I bet you I am alive. 
We'll wipe the floors together, nice try. 
Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 
Some days are complicated, 
Some ways i'll take the blame, 
Some days i take it all to, heart again. 
This place is made of panic, 
They check you every mile, 
Thank god you're going out for, a while. 
Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it. 
You're a black hole! 
Nobody noticed what you're talking about, 
Nobody's got a clue what you're all about. 
Save it all. 
Save it all.

Save it all, 
You have all the answers, 
Thank you for the memories and hope you go with it. 
Crying out, 
You have all the anger, 
Blame it on yourself again, there's nothing wrong with it.

Standing with a headache 
I try to fight but i cant deny the pain 
Reservations what i got from the bottom to the top 
On the bottle 5 times a day 
Standing with the top line 
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes 
And i'm shaking, and i feel so alive 
Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you 
When there's nothing on, 
You find yourself caught in the spotlight 
You try to fight but you cant delight the phase 
On your knees is what you're not 
Keeping what you got 
Don't try to hide your face 
Caught in a flashlight 
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes 
And i'm breaking, and i feel so alive 
Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you 
When there's nothing right 
When there's nothing right 
Stand up and face it 
Get up, don't waste it 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
You're bored out of ya mind 
Fighting all the time 
What's the worst thing that could happen 
What's the worst thing that could happen to you

Never have I felt these feelings before

We'll find a solution to keep my heart close to you
And I know, yes I know
If you hold me, believe me

There is nothing that I would not do for you
Forever be true

IN A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING GOES

JUST LIKE A ROSE
AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE HOPE IS GONE
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH TO CARRY ON
EACH TIME I LOOK AT YOU
THERE'S SOMETHING NEW

HERE NEXT TO ME
TO WIPE AWAY MY TEARS

CAUSE I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME SOME SHELTER
CAUSE I'M FADING AWAY
AND BABY, I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN[CHRISTIAN:] EVERY SINGLE HOUR
OF EVERY SINGLE DAY

IT MAY BE HARD TO BELIEVE
BUT GIRL YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I NEED
IT MAY BE HARD ALONG THE WAY
IT'S THIS FEELING I GET

CAUSE I'M FADING AWAY
AND BABY, I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN[CHRISTIAN:] I SAID BABY, I'M WALKING IN THE RAIN

We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?
Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But that's me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Oh the things that you say
Is it life or
Just a play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to 
remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway
Take on me, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two


I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You'll change
You'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2
You said you'd change
But I'm afraid
It's something I won't live to see
It's seems so strange
That sometimes fate
Can appear to be so real
And yet turn out to be a fantasy
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game ( Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you
You'll change, you'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2
Because of you, I guess we're through
Is this the way it has to be
I've been a fool (Ben - I've been a fool)
A fool for you (Ben - A fool for you)
But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're the same old brand new you
I can still remember the time you were there
When I needed to hold you, feel you
Everytime I ask you to find a new way
You lie a new way
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Instrumental break)
You'll change, you'll never change
You're never never gonna keep your promises x 2
Same old line, one more time
Say you're gonna be, there for me
Say you'll change, change your ways
Never gonna keep your promises
Same old game (Ben - You know it doesn't turn me on)
Brand new day (Ben - You're singing that same old song)
No more lies (Ben - If you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Another night, another day
What can I say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
When you're still the same old brand new you
Another night, another day
What I can say
You break your promises in two
What can I do
Another night, another day
What I can say
You're still the same old brand new you
You break your promises in two
What can I do
You're still the same old brand new you


You say we'll work it out, then you say you're having doubts. 
Tell me walk away, but then you'll go insane. 
Calling me day and night, saying he don't treat you right. 
Then you always turn around and give him one more chance.
Baby you know it isn't fair, you'll send me to be there. 
But we'd never get no-where.[Chorus:]
I've got one foot out the door, I don't wanna hear about him no more. 
I'll make along so we shall, time too make up your mind girl. 
No more back and forth, I don't wanna hear about him no more. 
If I'm not what you want, I don't wanna hear no more. 
Stop telling me you need more time, tired of the same old line. 
Better make a move or you are gonna find, are you taking it. 
Cos you know it's wrong, better let him know it's time too go your moving on. 
Baby you don't know how close I am to being gone.
Really known you long enough, 
I can only take so much, tell me if I have you heart. 
(How do you really love) 
Baby you know it isn't fair, you send me to be there. 
But we never get no-where. [Chorus]
(I don't wanna hear no more) 
If your sure that you really love me. 
(I don't wanna hear no more) 
Out the door if you still don't know. 
I'll be there for you and you know it's true, 
you belong to me. What you go and do (I don't wanna hear no more)[Chorus Till End]


Could be your eyes, could be your smile. 
Could be the way you freed my mind.
Your precious touch caressed my soul. 
You gave me everything I need, and know I'll lost. 
Lost forever.[Pre-Chorus:]
Lost forever, and you said this is going nowhere, girl. 
And you said I turned my back on. 
You said I'll not the only one for you.
Please give me one more try for the sake of our love
Let's give it one more chance coz I can't give you up.
I can't live one more day without you in my arms
I could never find another like you.
Could be the lies, could be my pride. 
Could be the days and nights so wild. 
Could be the times I wasn't there. 
And all the nights we didn't share, and now you've lost. 
Lost forever[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
I can't sleep, I can't live without you by my side. 
So cold, so lost without as my guide. 
You made me realise I've nothing, nothing without you.[Chorus]
Baby give me one last try


You and me, we sit and talk of friendship then I ask. 
If you can see, if we could be together forever. 
I see the light die in your eyes
Coz you're scared you'll hurt. 
So you don't wanna try.[Chorus:]
Well take a chance and come home with me, you could stay for eternity. 
If you try then at least you'll see
Then you'll never regret the things we never did.
You turn to me, I see your eyes. 
And somehow they cease to shine, you smile at me yet I can see. 
You don't think we can make it
You see the light die in my eyes. 
Coz I'm scared to lose you, I wish you would try.[Chorus:]
I see the light die in your eyes
Cos you're scared you'll hurt. 
So you don't want to try.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Too bad baby, can this be, is there something wrong with you and me. 
Guess we'll see I confess I don't know how we got into this mess might have guessed. 
Day by day you're slowly running out of things to say. 
So I may ask you why is it always me who has to try. 
To make things feel right.[Pre-Chorus:]
You never told what you feel inside, I thought you loved me, now I realise. 
No matter how I try
You never seem to be satisfied. 
And now you're tellin' me it's...[Chorus: x2]
Too bad baby that you're so good to me, I like you, you love me. 
Too bad baby you're so into me, I can't breathe. 
You fall in love too easily.
Me and you, are slowly running out of things to do, nothing new. 
I don't know, just why we don't agree, when I say YES, and you say NO. 
Don't be shy, please tell why it is that we don't see
Eye to eye
So confused, I'm feeling helpless and I'm feeling used. 
Like yesterdays news, girl[Pre-Chorus][Chorus][Break]
It started from the day I met her
Walked over me I let her. 
Friends who told me go and get her
They're telling me forget her. 
Too bad baby, Think I'm going crazy. 
Someone take me
Nothings gonna save me.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Let me tell you about this girl that once was mine
Once upon a time she's nothing but trouble. 
Up till now, was a man of common senses. 
Funny on how I just give up on my defenses, but she's one of a kind. 
Just a girl that could easily twist your mind, but right now it feels so fine.[Chorus:]
She's nothing but trouble
Trouble's her name. 
She's driving me crazy, it's kind of insane. 
I'm searching for reason, to let her go. 
Cause somewhere inside of me I know. She's nothing but trouble.
Everyone says I'll playing a game with fire, it's too late I'll just caught up my desire.
Cause she's one of a kind, just a girl that could easily twist your mind. 
But right now it feels so fine.[Chorus]
When I look in her eyes, it's just hard to anyone's advice. 
But somewhere I realize.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


You used to say that everyday. 
We will always be this way. 
Flying Angels lifting high to reach the sun were I belong. 
Girl you know you are the one. 
Above the clouds I see you cry. [Pre-Chorus:]
You know that when you smile. 
You stop the rain and we will be together. Once again. [Chorus:]
Although I'm gone, remember me. 
Please be strong I'll never leave. 
Just hold on, to the memories. 
Coz while I'll here, all I'm thinking about is tomorrow. 
I'll always know the love you've shown. 
Means I'll never be alone
There'll be times you wonder why. 
But seeing you with someone new. 
Used to make me feel so blue. 
But know I'm with you, all the time. [Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
From the moment that I looked into your eyes. 
All of my life I thought I'll be there. 
By your side, I wish I'll took the time to find the words to say. 
You know when you stop the rain. 
And we will be together once again. [Chorus]
Coz while I'm here, all I'm thinking about is tomorrow.


When she passes me by, she's a ray of light. 
Like the first drop of sun from the sky. 
And I know she's a queen who deserves a king. 
But I'm not a king, and she doesn't see me. 
When she dances, she moves me to a smile. 
I see everything near her shine. 
There is a grace in her ways I can't contain. 
I don't have the grace, she doesn't see me. 
And the closer I get I can't help but hide. 
So ashamed of my body and voice. 
There are boundaries we pass in spite of war. 
But our own, we can't seem to cross. 
He has a way that surrounds him, so delicate. 
With a glory the reigns in his life, he is also so much that he is not. 
These things, they don't see and she doesn't see me. 
There are things we can change, if we just choose to fight
But the walls of in justice are high. 
When she passes me by, she's a ray of light. 
Like the first drop of sun from the sky. 
And I know she's a queen, who deserves a king. 
Someone other than me, she doesn't see me, 
She doesn't see me.


What's your favourite scary movie?
I've walked the jungle, fought a lion with bare hands. 
The prince of darkness I'm a far better man. 
I've walked the dessert never feared for my own. 
Where lightning strikes I'll always go.
Eye of the tiger not afraid to attack, like Frankenstein, flat on my back. 
That Witch's magic took nothing from me. 
Cos you're the one whose gotta spell over me.[Chorus:]
If you're looking for danger here I come, you'd better look out it's just begun. 
There's something that I want you to know. 
One thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you. 
Get these shivers down my spine, feel my body turning blue. 
The feeling is so frightening it's driving me insane. 
One thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you
The terminator said he will be back, fight fire with fire that's a natural fact. 
Tell me your nightmare, I'll give you my dream. 
I will protect you whenever you scream.[Chorus:]
If you're looking for danger here I come, you'd better look out, it's just begun. 
There's something that I want you to know. 
One thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you. 
Get these shivers down my spine, feel my body turning blue. 
The feeling is so frightening it's driving me insane. 
One thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you. 
(I could've swore I heard her screaming)
Because you're always there, to let me know. 
Sometimes we all get scared, I'm telling you I can't let you go oh!.[Chorus][while chorus is going second time round]
I can feel it in the air and my fever's going down. 
There's a chill across the town, uh-oh-ooh-hoh![Chorus:]
One thing that I'm scared of is losing hold of you. 
I get these shivers down my spine, feel my body turning blue. 
The feeling is so frightening it's driving me insane. 
One thing that I'm scared of
Is losing hold of you.


Believe in your heart
No matter what the people might say. 
The chance you take could take you to the top.
Listen up
You know you gotta throw your fear away. 
Together we can make it
Shake it up baby.[Break][Bridge:]
Hear the voices rock the nation
A calling to the skies I can see eternity is in your eyes. [Bridge:]
Come on everybody there's a party to go to. 
They're holding out for you! 
With every chance you take, a change you make. 
The start of something new.[Chorus:]
All around the world they are singing
Calling to the beginning. 
Oh oh oh celebrate our love, People with imagination. 
Everywhere a celebration. 
Oh oh oh celebrate our love!
Good to be free
Living out our own destiny. 
The best will last forever
Never stop.
Gotta move
You know we gotta groove into the light. 
Tonight will be the night that we're breaking it up
Break it down baby.[Bridge][Bridge][Chorus:]
Oh oh, oh oh, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na. Oh oh, oh oh 
Celebrate our love.
Let the rhythm take control
Feel the fire burn within your soul. 
There's a magic in your eyes
Forever we can take the music thru the night.[Repeat Chorus: Till End.]


Where have you been all my life? 
Where have you come from? 
Is this your first time too? 
It's like I've known you in some other lifetime. 
We're part of the great plan. 
Like two stars the shine.[Pre-Chorus:]
I stood here watchin', while it only ever happened to friends. 
Now I don't have to pretend.[Chorus:]
I can't believe we're living the dream
We're diggin that scene. 
We finally made it through the fire. 
Something 'bout you blows me away, like night over day. 
Kissing the loneliness goodbye yeah.
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
I've been waiting for you all my life
Anticipating with ever dream ever night. 
Destiny's moment we all share in time love is the message. 
And I know I've got mine¡-[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love. 
Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me?[Chorus][Outro:]
True love, true love. Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me? 
True love, true love. Baby could this be. 
True love, true love happenin' to me?


I'm tired of fighting, got a fever when you try to get out. (Out, out, out) 
I've tried but I can't understand what all the fuss is about. 
I wish that I could be the man that you wanted me to be. 
I need you to see. [Chorus:]
I try and I try, yet I can't seem to fly. 
My soul full of pain when you cry, I wish I was perfect and god knows I try. 
But everything I do just tears your heart in two, I wonder why.
I never thought that being lovers meant that we can't be friends
If only I could understand what make you stay and stop breaking free from me
I wonder why.[Chorus]
Can't you see 
It's killing me, it's not the way things used to be. 
Can you remember yesterday, we used to smile without a care
Whenever you and I were near
Can't you see that I wanna be with you.
Oh baby! 
Oh oh oh, everything I do, tears your heart in two.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Don't speak, seal your lips. 
Please don't say a word, maybe I won't remember the words I have not heard. 
I see that you're in love, I know it's not with me. 
But I don't want the truth to haunt my memory.[Pre-Chorus:]
It's never too late to relight the fire
It's never stopped burning for me. 
The flame, it never died inside of me.[Chorus:]
How is it now that I can tell you I love you
How is it only now that it's too late. 
What can I do? 
The love that we had is torn in two. 
So you take the smiles from all of our years. 
I'll take the tears.
I sit and reminisce of times that we once shared. 
You gave me more than love. But never thought I cared. 
My feelings were all for you. 
Although it didn't show. 
I only told you on the day you let me to go.[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
Now I realize that you're no longer mine. 
But I'm hoping that the pain will ease in time. 
Although you're leaving, I won't say goodbye. 
Because I know you're here with me inside. [Chorus: Repeat Till End]


Have you seen the sunset, fade beneath a rain cloud? 
Have you ever chased your dreams away?
Did you ever think that? 
Life was just a highway, a never-ending road of lonely days. 
There are times we cry, and reach out to the sky. 
For the strength we need, to hold our head up high.[Chorus:]
All we need have to do now is love one another. 
Sisters and Brothers, can all live as one. 
And all we have to do now is show one another.
We all need each other, to love as on in love.
Have you seen a sunrise, promising you daylight?
When all you need is shelter from the storm. 
Have you ever felt that love was just an island
You can't survive on love all on your own.
There are times when I need to reach inside. 
For the strength I need, to hold my head up high.[Chorus]
If we push aside the blame, for the tears and the pain. 
You know love can reign, and the world will smile again.
If we push aside the blame, for the tears and the pain. 
You know love can reign, and the world will smile again.[Chorus: Repeat Till End]


[Paul:] You said that love was just a state of mind 
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find 
And for me you never really had the time 
I was blind. [Christian:] And everything that you meant to me 
Is written in the pages of my history 
But it's over now as far as i can see 
Suddenly [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [Mark:] Moving on she brings me brighter days 
Thoughts of you are in my mind always 
Like a memory that i can't erase 
It's here to stay [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [All:] So different 
([Mark:] it's so different) 
So easy 
([Paul:] so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
([Ben:] i can't get over you) 
So different 
([Paul:] it's so different) 
So easy 
([Mark:] so easy) 
But i can't get over you 
([Ben:] and i can't get over you) [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you [All:] And now i'm caught [Ben:] And now, i'm caught in the middle [Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy i was wrong 
And now i'm caught 
Caught in the middle 
Even though i'm with someone new 
All i can think about is you 
And now, i'm caught in the middle


When you're weary, When you're down and out
Lay your hands on me [x2]
I count my blessings, think of all I have
She never thought about it then threw it all away
Left it all to chance, She tore down fences
Now it seems so wasted wish she could turn back time.[Chorus]
Now she's down on her knees to pray
Baby please make it good, make it good somehow
She will do anything to change
So please make it good, make it good somehow
Someone please
When you're weary, when you're down and out
Lay your hands on me
had a vision. Time to make a stand
for all she is to me, to turn her life around
To take back yesterday's never easy
When you're wrong you're wrong. It seems impossible so[CHORUS]
Welcome to your revoloution 
What you dream is what you see
There's no rules or regulations
Let the music set you free[Chorus]
When you're weary, When you're down and out
Lay your hands on me [x2]


There's a chill in the air
Looks like the winter is returnin'
You know I have to stay 
Until I find a way to get through this
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
Now there's no healin' without some kind of pain
Hey baby, things have got to change
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain
I left it all to chance
Maybe the odds were all against me
Now it's out of my hands but I will see it through if you let me
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
And there's no healin' without some kind of pain
And you tell me baby, we can't go on this way
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain
When the truth behind the lies
All the dreams we left to die
Were just rivers runnin' dry
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain
No need to hide
I know the sunshine's on the other side
Won't let the storm roll over me
Set down these walls once and for all and set me free
Here comes the rain


Sunday morning time to say goodbye
But I'll be home real soon
Though I'm leavin', girl don't start to cry
I'll be thinkin' of you .... yeah
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again
How can i sing when my words have run dry
How can I smile with the tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you
Oh yeah, baby, oh
Now time and healin'
Another week come by
Girl it feels like years, hmmm...
I've been callin' every day and night
How i wish you were here,  ooh yeah..
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again
How can i say when my words run dry
How can I smile with the tear in my eye
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you
I never met a girl who is so this sweet
Can't wait to see you again, oh oh
I never had a love that was so complete
And you know that I'll be dreamin' 'til then
Oh, baby...
I said the time is now, baby...
How can I say when my words run dry (how can i say)
How can I smile with the tear in my eye (tear in my eye)
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you
Wooh yeah baby.. (how can i smile)
I said yeah, I said I'm missing you..(ooohh )
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June (ah)
That's how it feels (that's how it feels)
When I'm missing you

Crazy
The crazy things I heard you say  I’m mad about you all the same 
I never really saw the crime Yet went ahead and served my time
I never met someone like you before  But sometimes that is not enough
Cuz I can’t help just feeling
I must be crazy for leaving you Must be crazy for feeling blue
But my heart lately has been untrue I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you 
I will regret this chosen mind I never wanna see you cry
I care about u endlessly u deserve a deeper love than me
I don’t know if I’ll make it on my own But I tried so hard to let it go
And I can’t hide this feeling
And I know that I will miss you like a fool But there’s something in my life
And I can’t hide this feeling I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue But my heart lately has been untrue
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you


When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see that’s not the way
The story has to end 
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you’re on the wrong track
Give it time, you’ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You’ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you’ll learn to fly
In your head, so many questions
The truth is your possession
The answer lies within your heart (within your heart)
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope
And you will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see that’s not the way
The story has to end
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you’re on the wrong track
Give it time, you’ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You’ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you’ll learn to fly
Looking at your situation
There’s so much that you can do
Now’s the time to make your stand
This is just an observation
In the end it’s up to you
The future’s in your hands
And if you need to find a way back
Feel you’re on the wrong track
Give it time, you’ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You’ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you’ll learn to fly
Give it time
Then you’ll learn to fly


This punky clubwas spinning fores off a funky tee
I'm on the floor and she's watching me
Guess she was fine with a head to thigh inspection
With my back against the wall I play it casually
Man, I don't know but when she smiled at me
And started grinding her arse on the horn of some dirty trumpet
I had to say something
Camera shy, no style, getting it right I said I wanna take you home, tonight.
And she said
*Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture.
Love me if you like, but I'm not what you need.
And nothing comes for free. Isn't it cheap
As soon as she got me alone there was no(huh) hesitation
And she started taking off all her clothes to Lady Paris singing
I was jacking her up all night with a lethal injection
The way she alomost put up a fight, was so close to perfection
Tired eyes, no ties, turn on the light I want to see what gets you hot, tonight.
And she said[Repeat*]
isn't it cheap, when I'm down on my knees.
Talking sweet just to meet your demands. See your
delight as your stealing my night
Just to play it straight in to my hands[Repeat*]


Another picture on the wall
Another life I used to live
Another meaning once untrue
With every memory of you
Broken in my sleep
Another moment lost in time
You talked of love and I agreed
So many chances passed us by
And now I've lost the strength to try
Your love was never mine to keep
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed
If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
With every night I lie awake
With every day we grow apart
Is there a promise we can't break
We never learn from our mistakes
From the very start
We can't hold on we're losing track
So where's the road to take us back
And how did we forget what we believed
If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
Don't look back on yesterday 
Cuz the time has been and gone
Think of what tomorrow holds
Without you it feels so wrong
I can't carry on
If I can't have you
And if the love has gone
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on
And if you had to leave
And take my life forever
Cuz I would never be with anybody else
If I can't have you
Oh no
If I can't have you


She's all alone
Making her way to a cold, empty home 
Nobody waiting and no one to hold
She's holding her own 
He wakes up late
Stares at the mirror to find his own face 
Picks out the pieces he hides from within 
He doesn't fit in, do you?
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Opens her eyes
Looks around her 
There's faith in disguise 
There's no more secrets to shadow with lies 
She swallows her pride 
Somebody care, hard to be seen when there's nobody there 
It's getting closer, no need to pretend 
Just let it in and believe 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Maybe today or maybe tomorrow 
Guess the hands of fate
Been making you wait too long 
I know the way to forget all your sorrow 
Be the first in line to admit that you were wrong 
Sometimes 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Gonna make it through the night now baby 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night 
I've made up my mind 
Everything's fine 
We're gonna make it through the night


Sorry for making you cry 
For turning away 
As you walk on by 
But baby I need to be strong 
And I need to move on with my life 
You know it's not that I don't care 
So don't make me feel bad
It's not fair 
Baby you know all the reasons 
I made my decisions in life 
Now a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do 
And a boy had to become a man 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
You know it's not easy to do 
Turning my back on me and you 
But baby I need someone there 
Who will love me and care for my life 
Smiles they turned into tears 
And all of my dreams
They all disappeared 
Baby this cannot be right
So I'll turn down the light 
On our love 
Now a boy's gotta do
What a boy's gotta do 
And a girl had to do what she can 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you 
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
And everything that could gone wrong 
Has gone wrong at some time 
Now I can see the light 
It was love at first sight 
And I'm not gonna let this girl go 
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
>From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
Yes I Will
With you


Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
So beautiful , we had it all
No use looking to the past
We both knew it wouldn't last
But it was fun we had a blast
So beautiful, as I recall
Where did it go yeah...
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad
But they don't have to know
Do you remember singing, now?
Breaking rules we always would
Doing things we never should
We were so bad but it felt so good
Do you remember I think you remember
I wonder where you are tonight
But I know that you'll be alright
'Cos I see our star is shining bright
It's so beautiful, it will never fall
Where did you go
Come on now, sing it loud
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your guy'd get mad
But they don't have to know, yeah
Do you remember singing, now?
Looking back on yesterday
Memories won't fade away
I can't forget the love we made
So beautiful, we had it all
Where did it go 
Come on now, sing it loud
Say do you remember on the first of December
When we were riding on the backseat
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song
And there we were making out to the back beat
My girl'd get sad and your guy'd get mad
But they don't have to know
Do you remember singing now?


Take my hand, touch my face
Let me feel your embrace
Let me see in your eyes
That you won’t say goodbye
Just tell me how you feel
I don’t know what you’re thinking anymore
And if you need me, you’d kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you’d show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You’d hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I’m feeling strong
I sing you one last song
Let me ask time has passed
Do you feel this could last
If you don’t, why then stay
Take your wings, fly away
I love you way too much
To wanna be the one who brings you down
And if you need me, you’d kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you’d show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You’d hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I’m feeling strong
I sing you one last song
One last song I sing for you
Like I always did
This time it’s for real
I never come to you like this
Expecting you to turn my kiss
Oh no no no no no
And if you need me, you’d kiss me
Then tell me how you feel
And if you want me, you’d show me
That your love is for real
And if you love me
You’d hold me in your arms where I belong
So while I’m feeling strong
I sing you one last song
Oh yeah
I sing you one last song
I sing you one last song


[Mark:]
You said you need a groom this evening 
I told you I'm leaving 
Till you begged me to stay 
You got your high heels on to tease me 
You promised to please me 
Then you take it away [Mark:]
The fire is fading baby stoke it up 
And let it roll up your sleeves 
Why can’t you tell me that we're breaking up 
And that I need space to breath [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [Mark:]
Let it in[Paul:]
You used to keep me up till the morning 
Keeping me warm untill I had to be gone 
And now you can’t find a room in your head 
You see you got out of bed 
Well that my coffee ain't on [Paul:]
The door was open do you locked it up 
And then you threw out the key 
Why can’t you tell me that we're breaking up 
That I need space to breath [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [All:]
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait 
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait  [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [All:]
Let it out      
Let it in 
I can’t wait [All:]
If you can’t wait any longer 
Let it out      
Let it in 
If you think time will make you stronger        
Let it out      
Let it in [Mark:]
Let it out [Paul:]
No I can’t wait 
Till you let me in 
I can’t wait [Mark:]
No I can’t wait 
You got to let it out


You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
And for me you never really had the time
I was blind, oooh- oh
And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
Moving on she brings me brighter days
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Like a memory that I can't erase
It's here to stay, Wo-oooh
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
(And now I'm caught) And now, I'm caught in the middle
(So different) Nos différences
(So easy) So easy
(But I can't get over you) Plus rien ne t'efface
(So different) Nos différences
(So easy) So easy
(But I can't get over you) Plus rien ne t'efface
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Si nos différences nous donnent
La force que le jour on se pardonne
And now, I'm caught in the middle
Les raisons qu'ont avaient en nous
De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout
And now, I'm caught in the middle


What have I become
I wish that I could go some place
Where nobody knows you now
Nobody knows you now
Nobody knows you
This heart it weighs a ton
Some memories you can't escape
And nobody shows you how
Nobody shows you how[Chorus:]
Yet I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday
I don't want friends around
Still I don't wanna be alone, no no
Somebody hold me now
Somebody hold me now[Chorus:]
Cause I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday
Sometimes
A sinner becomes a saint
Sometimes
Believers can lose their faith 
Sometimes
We learn from our mistakes[Chorus:]
So I still wait for you
Living in this state for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It happens everyday
I'll wear these scars for you
I'll reignite the spark for you
Cause I believe a heart can change
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday
It Happens Everyday


I can feel that the wheel is in motion
And there's life in this old timer yet
Looking back there's a new reflection
Now I know what you give is what you get
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
‘Cause I don't wanna lose you again
Now I bet that your ears are burning
With three words on the tip of my tongue
I just hope that your heart is open
So that I can undo what I've done
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
‘Cause I don't wanna lose you again
Like a star, it's so hard to reach you
Not enough just to call you a friend
And I know that I don't deserve you
But I don't wanna lose you again, oh
In the end it's all or nothing
And I feel I'm ready now
So I try to be the answer
‘Cause I don't wanna lose you again
No, I don't wanna lose you again


You are like the ocean
And you're drowning me
The sunrise casting shadow
As far as I can see
'Cause you're so bitter sweet[Chorus:]
I'm in love, I'm in love
And I hate it
I'm in love and so overrated
What am I supposed to do
I wanna be with you
I'm in love, I'm in love, I can take it
I'm in love and feel so naked
What am I supposed to do
I wanna be with you
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I'm in love and I hate it
I hate it
Sometimes I feel spineless
I can't stand up straight
And sometimes I'm so stupid
I make the same mistake
But I can walk away[Chorus]
It's the agony, It's the extasy
And it's stolen me, And it's killin' me
And it's killin' me
I'm in love, I'm in love[Chorus]
I'm in love And I hate it
Hate it


Baby come back, hear me out
Is there any way to reach you now
Sitting on the edge thinking out loud
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know
Crying out loud, I wanna do good
I do it all for you if I could
The way it looks now from where I stood
Maybe there is something that you know
Something that only you know
But running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
Take a little time think this through
See it from another point of view
Putting myself in any old shoes
Maybe there is somewhere that you go
Somewhere that only you go
Trying to move on, all the way down
Waiting for your head to hit the ground
Whatever you're in we'll figure it out
I'll tell you there is something I do know
That wherever you go
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad [x4]
If you want it bad enough
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head (you can fight this illusion)
All in your head (all in your head)
All in your head (you can fight, you can fight)
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head (you can fight this illusion)
All in your head (all in your head)
It's all in your head
You can fight it
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
Running away isn't the way
Cause if you want it bad enough
Get it if you don't give up
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough
If you want it bad, if you want it bad
If you want it bad enough [x2]


Photographs in a card board box
Remind me I can't turn back the clocks
So far now from the starting blocks
I still don't know what this key unlocks
I say who
Made you give it away
Say who, Oh no
There's nothing left to say[Chorus:]
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now
Spiraling down
Memory lane I went
Hitting it hard
To hammer out the dents
No more sitting on a broken fence
It's to rebuild my confidence
I say who
Made you give it away
I said who, Oh no
There's nothing left to say, heh[Chorus:]
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now
We dance, we fall, we lose it all
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all
Nice to see that you're doing well
You're happy now as far as I can tell
We soldier on with the hands we're dealt
We're strangers now to the way we felt[Chorus: (2x)]
You and Me, seems we got
Nothing in common now
Nothing in common now
There's nothing to talk about
Like 2 ships sailing into
Different directions now
Isn't it funny how
We've Nothing In Common now 
We dance, we fall, we lose it all
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all


[Christian:]
I'm gonna take this chance to be up all night
I wanna fix this up just the way you like
I wanna shake the weight of the world, that's right
I gotta make the most of this old street light
And if you think I'm talking too much just tell me
If you need to change the pace then help me
We've got ten more minutes to go
I said, we've got ten more minutes before we go[Mark: (Ref)]
There's no regrets
At least not yet
And it's safe to go
I heard it on the radio
So I'll take you home[Ben:]
You know I need somebody to love me yes
You know that I won’t settle for second best
We gotta live like that ignore the rest
So if they all go east, then we'll go west
You know I dance my life to a different beat
And I like it here on the edge my seat
And now the stage is set, and we're alone
Where we end up later, we don’t know[Ref]
I take you home
Well, I take you home
And if it gets to crowded then may I suggest
That when they all go east then we'll go west
C'mon lets go, go, go
And where we end up, we dont know!
There's no regrets
At least not yet
And it's safe to go
And I heard it on the radio'[Ref]


I'm mad, still mad about you
It's too bad, I'm bad without you
Don't touch
you've already said too much
Pick and collect your stuff
T-shirts and your toothbrush
Cos that's all you've got 
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground
Lovesick, but I'm still sick of you
I quit, was too quick to love you
Don't touch
you've already said too much
Come back and collect your stuff
T-shirts and your toothbrush
Cos that's all you've got 
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground
There's no way back this time
So we gotta leave it all behind
Oh, oh, ohh
oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, ohh
oh, oh, ohhh
You can't keep what you're throwing away
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to say
Our love is six feet underground
You can't keep what you're throwing away
(there's no way back this time)
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to see
(So we gotta leave it all behind)
Our love is six feet underground
You can't keep what you're throwing away
(there's no way back this time)
Our love is six feet underground
I can't speak cause it's not easy to see
(So we gotta leave it all behind)
Our love is six feet underground[Repeat to fade]


I know a girl with a broken smile
He's been hurting her for quite a while
But she loves him
She still loves him
I've got a friend with a heart of gold
He loved his wife even when he was told
She's unfaithful
He still faithful
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know
Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it
I've seen a man working all his life
Lose his job to a new device
Still he's grateful
Yeah, he's grateful
I know somebody who's got all they need
Who built an empire stepping on the weak
Still ungrateful
So ungrateful
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know
Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it
Who decides this?
It seems so unfair
Is there somebody
Somebody out there?
Who decides this?
Does anyone care
Is there somebody
Somebody out there? [x4]
Why do good things happen to bad people
Bad people
Don't deserve it
Why do bad thing happen too good people
Good people
Don't deserve it


Some of us were born to break
The slightest knock is all it takes
I'm sleeping while I'm wide awake, woah
I've tried to thicken up my skin
I'm having trouble fitting in
I'd rather sink than never swim, woah
Now all my life I have learned
It's me just me against the world[Chorus:]
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster
Everytime I talk I choke
I hide behind the songs I wrote
It's killing me with every note, woah
Will all my fears be confirmed 
Is it me just me against the world[Chorus:]
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster
As far as I am concerned
It's now you and me against the world[Chorus:]
Now the world's moving faster
This could be a disaster
Is the change that I'm making
Worth the risk that I'm taking
Now the world's moving faster
This could be ever after
Is chaos creating 
The Perfect Disaster


I meet someone the other day
It's good to see her face again
She's the one who got a way
Way back when
Showed photos of her family
Soon to marry mum to be
She used to want all that with me
And she smiled and I laughed[Chorus:]
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would I be standing at the altar by her side?
Would her child be mine?
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
She's happy now and that's a fact
And who am I to mess with that
So I won't try to get her back
In a way I'm glad
'Cause that was then and this is now
Still I can't help but think about
All the things that I'm without
But I wave the white flag[Chorus:]
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would I be standing at the altar by her side?
Would her child be mine?
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
And as she was walking away
I thought I saw her
Turn back and hesitate
Look at me as if to say
I imagined if you didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would you be standing at the altar by my side?
What would our child look like?[Chorus:]
Then I imagined if I didn't take that fight
What would my world be like?
Would I be standing at the altar by her side?
Would her child be mine?
And it's the strangest thing
And I think that I've just seen
The Life That Could Have Been
The Life That Should Have Been


Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze
Wanna improvise with you
Put the world to rights with you
Let me put your mind at ease[Chorus]
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
Out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...
Come and raise a glas with me
Reminisce and laugh with me
Go for broke and paint with me
Come on roll the dice with me
Flip the bird to life with me
We can turn this all around[Chorus]
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
And there's more than enough to spare
There's a whole lotta love out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...
All I'm saying is
Climb the wall you've been facing
Catch the wave you've been chasing
We've got something to live for now
Come around to mine won't you
Wanna spend some time with you
Cut the chord and shoot the breeze[Chorus]
There's a whole lotta love out there
There's a whole lotta love out there
And there's more than enough to spare
There's a whole lotta love out there
Doo doo doo doo doo...


I miss your breathing
When sleep doesn't come
I cant help pretending you'll be home
I cant face the future
Now your in the past
Seems all of the best things never last[Chorus]
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
They say I get through this
But how could they know
How can I make it on my own
Your here in the shadow
You cover my heart
And I hear you whisper in the dark[Chorus]
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come
I don't wanna let you go
But in time
But in time
I'll wake up for all I know
I'll be fine[Chorus]
But there's no use in crying
There's no point denying
I'm waiting for daylight to come


Baby don’t, baby don’t, treat me right
I better get, better get outta sight
Guess my dinner’s in the dog tonight
Shouting out, shouting out at me all night
Ringing in my ears till the morning light
Baby just wanna have a fight tonight
Alright, it’s okay
Tomorrow’s another day
I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try
Baby don’t, baby don’t break away
Hear me out, hear me out, what I say
I can’t take it for another day 
Burning up, burning up, baby stop
Cool it down now before you blow your top
I guess the dog’s back sleeping in my spot
Alright, it’s okay
Tomorrow is another day
I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me 
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
I would never tell you lies
You know I’m not that kind of guy
Cos I’m just trying to make it right
Trust me you can’t trust me
Trust me you can’t trust me
But try
Just trust me
Try


Standing in line, talking ‘bout nothing
When you walk right by
And I wanna say something but 
I’m so shy it hurts
You don’t see me if I gave you my compass
Then would you be more like Christopher Columbus
And explore my world
Hey now I’ve gotta tell you
No I’m bursting to tell you
I can’t keep it inside
Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come knock knock on my door
So the secret’s out I’ve been discovered
I’m feeling vulnerable my heart’s uncovered
But there’s no reply
I’ll still be here
I’ll still be waiting
I’ll keep a look out until your ship comes sailing in
Will you ever be mine
Hey now how can I show you
I’m bursting to tell you
I can’t keep it inside
Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door
Am I too late
Have you been discovered
I wish I’d been more like Christopher Columbus
And found you first
Oh here goes, the truth is I’m yours
But I may not be necessarily
What you’re looking for
But oh who knows what fate has in store
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Come take a chance on me baby
Come knock knock on my door
Oh come knock knock on my door


I got it wrong I made you angry so it seems
Say I’m a douche bag 
But I don’t know what that means
I’m in the doghouse baby please throw me a bone
You need some space but I can’t bear to be alone
And I don’t know how to control your temper
Just breathe in breathe out
I don’t like it when you sit there quiet
Say it’s nothing but I just don’t buy it
Think there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know what’s coming
Yeah, there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
I tried to call you like a hundred times today
You’re so black and white
When I’m all different shades of grey
I come around to see you but it only makes it worse
This won’t be our last fight 
And it sure hell ain’t the first
I wanna hear you shout 
Let go of your temper
Just breathe in breathe out
I don’t like it when you sit there quiet
Say it’s nothing but I just don’t buy it
Think there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
Here we go I know I should start running
See your face and then I know what’s coming
Yeah, there’s gonna be a riot
A riot
I don’t like it when you sit there quiet
Say it’s nothing but I just don’t buy it
Think there’s gonna be a riot
A riot

Is Anybody there? I come up for air
Feels like I’m drowning
Does anybody care?
It makes no sense at all
Such a long way to fall.
I knew it was coming
I could feel it in the air
Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I've fallen from grace
Is anyone around?
My head hits the ground
I feel like I’m no one
I’m lost in the crowd
It makes no sense at all
So divided we fall
I’m breaking my silence
But you don't hear me call
And you don’t see me fall
Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I've fallen from grace
And everyday just feels the same
I try so hard to walk away from everything I am
Just closing in on me
I just can’t face the pain
I sit around and wonder why?
So many dreams can fade and die
Well nothing is forever everything is never
And I can’t say goodbye
Feels like I’m falling
It’s time but your stalling
You said all you need is a little time and some space
These words that you've spoken
Have left me so broken
Seems at this moment that
I’ve fallen from grace


Starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking out on the same sky starlight
Everybody gets down sometime
When I get down I turn to rhyme
I write lyrics like diary 
When the words come out yeah it's good for me 
But every body needs a little help
When you lost for words and you can't help yourself
Just step out to your balcony and
Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking on the same sky starlight
Why (do) you lost your confidence
You're beautiful, it don't make sense to me
It's been a while since I've seen you laugh
Last time you face it for a photograph
And when there's no one to hold ya
And you're all out of hope 
Just remember what I told ya
Just step out to your balcony and
Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining up for you
We'll looking at the same sky starlight
Every night in a way you'll find me
I'm in the sky the moon beside me
Just look around and they're out here 
Waiting waiting for you [2x]
I'm waiting for you [3x]
Just look up to the starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We'll looking out on the same sky starlight
Every night in a way you'll find me
Just look around and they're out here 
Starlight
Even though I'm not with you tonight
Just let them light up your room
You know that they're shining for you
We're looking out on the same sky starlight


Your eyes they tell me something
I heard a rumor saying you're alone again
On your own again
That really got me thinking
I know that you're looking for love but maybe
Until then you just need a friend
We don't have to tell nobody
Our secret safe don't worry
No string no complication
It's just a win-win situation
Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]
Go separate ways when leaving
Both know when later you'll be home with me
Be alone with me yeah 
No heart that we're deceiving
No harm in what we're feeling
As long as we don't think of what could be
We don't have to tell nobody
Our secret safe don't worry
No string no complication
It's just a win-win situation
Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]
Go out go out
Don't stop don't resist
Cause you and I can coexist
When the lights go out [3x]
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits
When the lights go out [3x]


No more drama 
I'm going under 
With your face so full of thunder 
Lay it on me Evidently 
There's an elephant in the room 
Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me cause it's killing me 
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
When it comes down 
To the wire 
One spark can start a fire 
So come on now 
Let it all out 
Before my heart goes tick tick boom 
Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me cause it's killing me 
Think about how eleven letters 
Mean the world when they're put together 
They can change our lives forever 
Say them now cause it's now or never
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
I forgive you (ahhhhhhhhhh)
You'd save my life
I forgive you [2x] (ahhhhhhhhh)
You'd save my life...


I used to be stardust
Then came the big bang
Then I turned to mountain the bed rock the sand
Chiseled and broken
Shaped by a man
Turned into weapon in his hands
Too many stones [3x] have been thrown
A piece of a bridge
A break in a wall
I can be anything at all
A tip of an arrow
The very first wheel
I held the command and always will
Too many stones [3x] have been thrown
So lay me down, build a path
Walk on me together
Let me be your common ground
And hold on to each other
Lay me down
Lay me down oh
Too many stones have been thrown
Too many stones [3x] have been thrown
Oh lay me down
Too many stones (Lay me down)
Too many stones (just lay me down)
Too many stones have been thrown
Too many stones (just lay me down)
Too many stones (too many stones)
Too many stones have been thrown
A piece of a bridge
A break in a wall
I can be anything at all


When I'm Grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Like a ship against the tide
Still I know, there's a simple truth
I am Grateful
When I hear the saddest song
In that moment
I know I am not alone
Someone else, feels the same way too[Chorus]
To be Grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be Grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break
Ever Grateful
For the scars along the way
And I'm thankful
For each mistake I've made
Cause somehow, It all led me to you[Instrumental][Chorus]
To be Grateful
Even in my heartache and my pain
To be Grateful
When it feels like I'm about to break
When I'm Grateful
And I'm starring at the sky
I feel so small
Still so good to be alive
Cause I know, I shared it all with you

I feel the joy in this Christmas time
But something's missing in this heart of mine
The Choirs sings that the season's here
I always miss you this time of year
It's crowded out in Trafalgar square 
But it feels so empty when you're not there
They're all waiting for snow to fall 
But I'm still waiting for a miracle
I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
If New Year comes and my gifts still there
The lights come down and the tree is bare
I'll keep it wrapped til December then
I'll place it under the tree again
I left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
Pray the lights lead you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time
Christmas morning finally 
I run downstairs excitedly
Then to my surprise I see
The greatest gift in front of me
You left your heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas 
You left my heart underneath the tree
I believe after all it's Christmas
I guess the lights led you back to me
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas
Oh...
I believe after all it's Christmas time


I watched the ice melt away
I saw the cold wind change
But like in an old snow globe
In my world, it's always winter
As flakes settle to the ground 
You turn me upside down 
And back to start I go
In my world, it's always winter[Chorus:]
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
Resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
Waiting farewell
To Another Year Gone
Here on your window sill
It's as if time stood still
I'm stuck in this wonderland 
But it's all fake
It's only glitter [Chorus:]
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
Resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
Waiting farewell
To Another Year Gone
Be careful how hard you shake
Cause one day this glass will break
Water will flow like tears
And I'll sail away on that river[Chorus:]
Another Year Gone
I've been here too long
All of my new years
resolution have gone wrong
I'm still on this shelf
All by myself
Another Year Gone

She loves you yeah...... yeah..... yeahh.......


I can’t help but I wanna be around you
Can’t forget about my home
When I’m lonely
You might not know but I always think about you
As you fall upon your soul
I wanna thank you
Home is where I belong
It’s a place, I’m taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on
Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down
You’re always around when I have some time to steal
When I need some time to heal 
For remedy (for remedy)
And there are times when it’s hard to be myself
Turn me into someone else
But you know me
Home is where I belong
But it’s a place, I’m taken from
Hold a prayer, save a song
Shine a light and keep it on
And on and on
Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Stay around
Come on down
Come on down
Call on to please me tonight in a while
Just so I’m kind when I’m home
Days turn to seasons and years have gone by
Hold on
Come on down
There’s a fire in my heart
Stay around
Coz I need you here right now
Come on down
And take me back to solid ground
Come on down[Instrumental]
I said come on down
Coz there’s a fire in my heart
I said and you’ll look down
Just I need you here right now
You gotta come on down
And bring me back to solid ground
Come on down


Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love [2x]
We can stay up all night by the moonlight
Watch the sunrise with the butterflies
We can fight all night, we can yell and cry
We never say goodbye
We're always side by side
I will go where you go
Side by side
We are two, forever
Together we will grow
This is our fight
It's now or never...
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love [4x]
Some days we are afraid of waves
Some days we surf 'em!
You and me, we have our days
And I don't wanna lose them
I will go where you go
Side by side
We are two, forever
Together we will grow
This is our fight
It's now or never...
So..
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love [4x]
We can, we can fall down,
Down, down, down
We never, we never hit the ground
Ground, ground, ground
Somehow (somehow), we always get up
Up, up, up (yeah)
Sometimes (sometimes), even to the top (even to the top...)
I will go where you go
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)
Beautiful, critical, typical, cynical, physical, miracle love (we got a miracle love..)


Today when I saw you 
I knew it was just like the first time
When you met my eyes I came close
And I felt like the first time
To hold back my fear
and feel you so near
I’ve never been this far before
To hold back my fear
and feel you so near
I’m scared of falling into deep this time
Do I need a reason to tell you why
I’m singing you this song
Do I need a reason to show you that
I know where I belong
Whenever I am weary I lean on
this feeling that I have
I am so much stronger now
Thankful, yes I am
Today I’ll renounce them,
the doubts and the fears I’ve been nursing
I’ll fly like a moth to the flame
and I’ll feel like the first time
To hold back my fear
and let you come near
I’ve never been this far before
To hold back my fear
and let you come near
I’m ‘fraid of loosing and still I go


You just found heaven,
It's safe to say you'll do it again.
It's been a while since you needed a shoulder to cry on,
Now you're coming to me for a helping hand,
You're out all night fooling around,
It just ain't right the way you're letting her down,
It's the same old story time after time.
Take a look at your life, 
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just can't get it right,
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
How can you turn your back on the girl you rely on,
Then you leave it to me to try and turn it around,
Now you're up all night, head in your hands,
How can I help you understand,
It's the same old story time after time.
Take a look at your life (take a good look),
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again (you know you'll do it again),
You just cant get it right (oh no you cant),
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
I can't believe you did it again,
Your only breaking your heart like this,
Till it's tearing you apart and then,
You're right back where you started. 
Now you're up all night, head in your hands,
How can I help u understand,
It's the same old story time after time,
Oh baby.
Take a look at your life (take a good look),
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just cant get it right (oh no no no),
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.
Take a look at your life, 
You just found heaven and threw it away,
It's safe to say you'll do it again,
You just cant get it right,
But I'll be here for you my friend,
Just like before you'll do it again.


Put it on to me
I can hear you baby
'Cause we've been
Here once before
I can feel the heat
Don't you feel it baby?
And it makes me
Want you more
Didn't you tell me yesterday
We gotta take it all the way
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
'Cause I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it, ooh
And now
You're close to me
We got to move together
And I've never
Felt so sure
Your sexuality,
I'm in a love hangover
The rhythm of your body
Is the only cure
Carried away
Like butterflies
Feeling the music
Takes you high
Baby, You know we're
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop
'Cause I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it, ooh
I like it, ooh,
Don't you know
I like it,
I like it
Go for the stars
And feel the sky
We gotta do
That everytime
We're funkin' up
And I like it
Now you're getting hot
Give it all you've got
We're funkin' it up
And I like it
Now you're burnin' up
Never gonna stop[Repeat to fade]


I keep trying 
Ain’t no denying
We should be together now
I can’t imagine
You’re with another man
Baby, it can be wrong
To play with, in this love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
You can’t hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
You can’t hide your love
(Hide your love)
(You gotta hide your love)
I can remember
Last time you needed me
I’m always here left to know
And when it all goes wrong 
And things are not the same
I’m always your price to pay	
But I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
You can’t hide your love from me
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
You can’t hide your love
(Hide your love)
(Hide your love, oh my)
Can we, in this love
Yes I still need your love
After all of this time
(All of this time)
All of this time
You can’t hide your love from me
(From me, deep inside…)
Deep inside your heart, you’ll see
I can’t walk away if you want to stay
(Walk away, if you wanna stay)
You can’t hide your love


[Ben]
Maybe I don't even exist
So I'll stay anonymous
It's over and the situation shouted in shame
And they say it's down to us
But what do they know[All]
So write, this time
Till it's starting or ending
I'll never get tired of your lies[Ben]
But what you've got to visualize[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry[Ben]
Either get it high or go dry
This time[Paul]
I see you're playing that song again
You never show your hand 
To let me in[Paul]
You keep it all inside yourself
And cry to no one else
But I catch your tears[All]
So I write[Ben]
So I write,this time
This time
Till it's starting or ending ([Ben:] starting)
I'll never get tired of your lies[Paul]
But what you've got to visualize ([Ben:] oh, oh)[All]
It's so intoxicating
We either get it high or go dry
Either get it high or go dry[Paul]
Either get it high or go dry[Mark]
You say this love will see another day
But at least tonight
You'll be mine[All]
So I write ([Mark:] so I write), this time ([Mark:] this time)
Till it's starting or ending ([Mark:] starting or ending)
I'll never get tired of your lies ([Mark:] oh, oh)[Paul]
But what you've got to visualize[All]

[Chris:] Fallin' for a fantasy
I threw away my destiny
I don't know where to stop
Feelin' broken-hearted
I'll think about it
And to see my eyes 
To cry to dry
for I've forced
All this time [2x]
With you, ooh...[Chris:] I was tempted by the power of desire
I surrendered to the calling of the fire
There's nothing I could ever say
to change the things I did
But I promise you
I'll make it up to you[Mark:] Take me back to yesterday
When all our dreams were swept away
I'd never crossed that line
I changed across of time
I could never live this way
If only you'd forgive
We'll start again
With all my heart
All my love for you [2x][Mark & Chris: (chorus)][break][Mark & Chris:] No surrender no return
If only you believe that...[Chris & Mark: (chorus)]


Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind.
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud
Your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you...
Yes your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you...
When we are together the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart
Your once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you... I love you


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white
And may all your Christmases be white
(Your Christmases be white)


[Ben:] The sun is shining, the rain comes in 
And i don't know what to do, no... 
I don't know where i'm going or where i've been cos my mind is hooked on you. 
Words escape me and tears come down and day slowly turns to night 
And i think of all we could have been, 
I gave up the fight. [Ben:] And you don't 
([All:] you don't), 
Understand 
([All:] understand), 
Girl you make me all i am, 
But i'm starting to see, just how hard it can be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? [Ben:] You said that we'd been defeated 
But oh i am so addicted 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why 
No, i don't know why [Paul:] The days around me and years roll on 
And i still don't think it's right 
([All:] don't think it's right) 
And i have so much love to give, 
But i gave up the fight. [Paul:] Now you don't 
([All:] you don't), 
Understand 
([All:] understand), 
Girl you made me all i am, 
Now i've started to see, just how hard it could be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? [Ben:] You said that we'd been defeated, 
But oh i am so addicted, 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true, 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why. [Paul:] No i can't make it alone 
([Ben:] i don't know why) 
And i can't be here without you in my life 
And so i ask you, why, you still deny? [Ben:] And you don't, 
Understand, 
Girl you made me all i am 
But i'm starting to see, just how hard it can be, on my own 
And i'm sorry baby won't you come home? [All:] You said that we'd been defeated, 
But oh i am so addicted, 
Your love is all i need to get by. 
You told me that you and i would always be true, 
But you lied 
And you're not in love and i don't know why. [Ben:] No, i don't know why, 
Just tell me why, 
Please tell me why.

[ACAPELLA:]
Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know
Let me know[VERSE 1:]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You want to keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see[CHORUS:]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know. . .[VERSE 2:]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
what I say I'm all about, all about[CHORUS][BRIDGE:]
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own)
Try and find another place for me
Cause. . .[CHORUS]
Ah, ah, ah - ha
See stay at your best baby


No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do 
No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do
Liyah you're the only one for me,[3x]
the one for me, the one for me[chorus]
No one knows how to love me quite like you do... [4x][Verse 1]
When it comes down to the things I like
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
You pick me up when I'm down, you put my feet on solid ground
And you make me your first priority[Bridge]
(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
(Cause I like it) cause I like it, babe
Don't stop cause no one knows...[chorus][Verse 2]
When there are clouds on a rainy day
You know how to bring sunshine to my life
And I've never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm your goddess[Bridge][chorus][rap]
Well it's the L-I-Y-A-H plus the second chapter
R Kelly's spitin' tracks, as if it were tobacco
It's the ninties, time to get the pockets phat
So when I say "book", you say "read that"
Now back to the matter of the song
No one knows how to love me like you do
I got words for you...
Uh! Forever my man!!![chorus]
Liyah you're the only one for me, [3x]
the one for me, the one for me [till fade...]


[Chorus:]
I'm so into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you[Verse 1]
Baby can't you see I got a thing for you
I really like the way you do the things you do
Take control of me fullfill my fantasies
Here's my pager number won't you get with me[Bridge]
It's just the little things you do that turns me on
You really turn me on
And you got it goin' on I'm into you[Chorus][verse 2]
My dear I feel so weak you knock me off my feet
And it's good to know you love me just for me
I'll be here all the time I'll never let you go
There is something that I have to let you know[bridge][chorus][rap]
Well can't you see Aaliyah's got a thing for you
And the second chapter like the things you do
So pull up to my bumper and I'll ride wit' you
And let's go rollin' down a block or two
Now add a little bass to the E Q button
Now all of a sudden I gotta whisper sweet little nothing
Aaliyah told me to tell you to call her
(I'm so into you)[chorus till fade...]
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na!!!


Street Thing 
Street Thing
You and me got a street thing going on[Verse 1]
Now that we have come to know each other
I'll never go away, love will always stay here forever...
Cause this thing we've got is very rare, yeah
So don't ever go nowhere, no[chorus]
Cause you and me got
A street kinda thing goin' on
And I'm so happy that I found you
Our love ain't goin' nowhere
It's gonna stay right here
Right here forever[Verse 2]
You'll never have to ask a second time
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me
So there's no doubt in my mind, no
Boy this love we have is o so real, oh yes it is
That's why I'm never goin' nowhere, no[chorus]
Yo Liyah, why don't you take it to the bridge
and let 'em know how you really feel[bridge]
You can climb the highest mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
But boy I gotta let you know
My love will always be[repeat till fade...]


[chorus:]
Young nation under a groove
Keeping it smooth with a jazz attitude
Young nation under a groove keeping it smooth
Young nation under a groove
Keeping it smooth with a jazz attitude
Young nation under a groove keeping it smooth
As I'm strollin' down the park with really nothing on my mind
Laid back and I'm just thinkin' of old times
Pumpin' our Isley Brothers tape when I'm waxin'
Peepin' through my sideview checkin' out my waxin'
Hey! I gotta say today's a good day for me to lap around the way
Ho! Time to hit the six-four
And pump the bass and I'm Just a little known
Aaliyah's in the house so I think you'd better check my flow
Hello! Hello!
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the one the two and to the three-ee-ee[chorus]
I check my celular because my beepers beepin'
Booty calls are creepin'
Fellas on the corner beepin' me (Wassup, wassup)
Don't set it off
So I pick up my girls and hit the streets just because...
Jazz-aray, it's Saturday and...
The sun is blazin', and it's so amazin'
And if you are a YNP and you're rollin' with the PGP, congratulations
I know I got the skills to make you trip
R Kelly's flippin' tracks so grab a hold and don't you sit
The nigga diggin nation that's a sooner gets my grip
So raise your hands if you're sure...
Are you a young nation?[chorus]
Well, six o' clock, girls are round and now I'm steppin'
Stop to get some dressin', to the mall I'm flexin'
You know to get them funky croaka-sacks
Tonight I'm hittin' the town, ain't holding nothing back
Hey!, Well alright tonight is the night
Well I'm in the mood for celebration, or even some jazzy conversation
Hey! It's O.K here I come so anyway
I'm the young nation and young nation is me
So here we go from the one the two and to the three-ee-ee[chorus 2x]
Hey! It's a great day, the lover on the way, Young Nation...

Tryin' to figure out how I could make my own records
Workin' in restaurants, bustin' on dishes
Hopin' that the man upstairs respect my wishes
Cigerette lighters, Ardig wallets, I was sellin' them
'Till I met the B H and bust down a capella to him
He said you got talent and you're goin' places
I'd heard that line before but what the heck I signed the papers
Ever since that day I drew my head high it was on
And now I'm mixing new music with the old school songs
R. Kelly play me something from the old school
R. Kelly play me something from the old school
R. Kelly play me something from the old school

If your girl only knew That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew That you was dissin' her to talk to me
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew That I would want to kick it with you (if she knew)
And if your girl could only see How you be calling me, getting fresh with me
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me

She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone

[Tann]:
Baby girl you got the whole world screaming
Giving it up for you
You got the party people fiending
Bump it to the roof
From the left side to the right side
And straight to the back
Ain't nothing going on here but a dirty money track
Got the party people waving their hands and doing the rodeo
Aaliyah, why don't you kick it, kick the flow[Aaliyah][1] -I came to give my love
To the fans across the world
Reach out to you
Touch the hearts of boys and girls[Repeat 1 (3x)]
Came to spread my love
Do do do


[Verse - 1]
Did you sleep on the wrong side? 
I'm catching a bad vibe 
And it's contagious, What's the latest? 
Speak your heart, Don't bite your tongue 
Don't get it twisted, Don't misuse it 
What's your problem? 
Lets resolve it 
We can solve it, What's the causes? 
It's official, You got issues 
I got issues, but I know I miss you [Chorus - 1]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. [Verse - 2]
I want to know: Where were you last night? 
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out 
I want to know: Were your fingers broke? 
If you had let me know, I wouldn't have put on my clothes   
I want to know: Where'd you go instead? 
Cause it was 4 in the morning, When you crept back in the bed 
I want to know: What was in your head? 
Or what was in my head? Am I supposed to change? [Chorus - 2]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? And will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? and who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. [Bridge - Aaliyah]
Baby let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) [Rap - Timbaland]
Girl holla!! 
You give me bits and pieces 
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason 
I think it's just the season, Maybe the month, Maybe the building 
Now tell me what's the reason? Snoop video? Looks are deceiving 
So, cut the crying, Cut the coughing, Cut the weazing, Girl 
Quit the blaming, Cut the naming, Cut the sleeping, Girl 
I think you need some prayer, Better call the deacon, Girl 
So, get your act right or else we won't be speaking, Girl 
So, what's it gonna be? Freaky, freaky... Me and you? 
Or is it gonna be who blames who? 
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars 
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow


I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Kill All That Loose Rap
How Many Times I Tell You "Don't Come To Me."?
You Bring Me All Of That Jealousy 
Cause You Got Envy (Don't Hate Me Baby)

So Many Times You Guys Would Come Step To Me
I Guess You Call Yourself Booking Me
But Do I Look Easy? (It Ain't Easy)
Well, It Never Hurts To Try
I Just Might Let You Call Me
I Hope You Don't Plan On Buggin' Me
That Would Be Ugly
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Kill All The Loose Rap
You Can Quit That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
So You Can Stop All Your Loose Rap, Your Loose Rap
So Many Times I Hear Trying To Knock My Crew
Well, We've Got Something For All The Fools
It Ain't Just Rhythm And Blues
If You Just Quit Trying To Compete (Yeah)
No Telling What You Could Be
Might Even Be Doper Than Me, I Doubt It
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I Don't Want All That Loose Rap
You Can Keep That
I Know You Can Come Better
Can Come Better Than That
I'm Sick And Tired Of The Loose Rap
You Can Save That

I Gave It All To You
With No Questions Asked
I Wanted A Future
Who Cares About My Past?
That First Argument
You Up And Left
I've Seen A Change In You
Words I Won't Accept
I Thought I Lost You
When You Twist Back My Arm
Cause The Man I Thought I Knew
Wouldn't Do Me No Harm
And That Ran Through My Mind, Over Again
I Promised Myself You Wouldn't Put Your Hands On Me Again
Never No More
I Didn't Sleep That Night
I Held My Pillow Tight
Now Trust Me When I Say
You Have Been Told
I'm Telling You Never To Touch Me No More
Never No More
I Should've Left You
When You Called Me Out My Name
I Stooped To Your Level
Replied You The Same
Now Here We Are Again
You At My Throat
Now I See The Same Old Change
That I Did Before
I Walk Away From You
At The Drop Of A Dime
So Often This Treatment
Is Way Out Of Line
And That Ran Through My Mind, Over And Over Again
Promised Myself You Won't Put Your Hand On Me Again
Never No More
You Know I Rather Give You Your Space
Cause I Just Don't Know 
Whot To or not To Say
Stay Out Your Way, Or Get In Your Face
I Just Know You Better Not Touch Me Again
Or I'll Walk Away 
That Is One Game I Refuse To Play
I Didn't Sleep That Night
I Held My Pillow Tight
Now Trust Me When I Say
You Have Been Told
I'm Telling You Never To Touch Me No More
Never No More

Late afternoon, the sun's going down
I ca-ca-call on your cell (why's he in such a hurry)
Leaving the room, he's mumbling, too
Asking for his shoes, (just leaving outt he blue)
No explanation, no actual location
Just watching him pacing (wonder who he's stressing)
Little conversation, leavin' no debation, he left the door swingin'
You better open your mi-in-ind
To read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines
9 in the morning, up, up, up way before breakfast
Homeboy gettin restless
(the room is full of questions)
Little replyin, whole lot of denyin'
You're steady collidin
(so why do he keep on trying)
I s-search for the median, now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason
(he's changing like the seasons)
Are you still pleasing, well soon you'll be leaving
Which one will be grieving?
You better open your mind
To gotta read between the lines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines
Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told
Look in his eyes, yougotta read between the lines
Your replies are getting old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin told
Look in his eyes, yougotta read between the lines
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause I, I know what's going on
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
Cause that, that ain't what I'm on
Hope you don't think you can throw the line over me
'cause you'll look up, and I'll be gone
I hope you ain't making plans on running me
'cause I read between the lines
Who got you thinkin' you ishh ain't been stinkin'?
My temperatures peakin'
(why are you barely speakin)
I'm bustin' his bubble, and he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles
(i'm listening but hardly believing)
Changing the story, or trying to ignore me
Still reaching out for me
(but still I'm hardly reaching)
Give me a reason to put you back on line
You've wasted enough time
I had to open my mind
To read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines-ines
You gotta read between the li-ines
You gotta read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes, you gotta read between the lines
Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old

Lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes, gotta read between the lines

oh oh.....
Gave you chances on top of chances
Opportunities taken for granted
My reality is all your exshalities
Cause insanity 
Why you askin'me?
Took my kindness for a sign of weakness
My own blindness cause my sadness
No longer am a slave over your madness
I am glad it's finally over
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me
Is forget you knew my name
See your qualities are less than pleasing
I got more than one reason for leaving
It's time to close shop, open new chapters
See new beginnings is what I'm after
Get your skeletons up out my closet
Don't make me lose it, I just might lose it
Who do you think you are now? (Yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Can't believe)
Who do you think you are now? (Yeah yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah babe)

I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah yeah yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy
See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you need to do is forget you knew my name
I'm a play ya to you've left
Cause you talkin' me to death
See I ain't even sad that I'm here all by myself
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve boy (Yeah yeah)
Who do you think you are now?

This Is Where I've Got To Draw The Line
Cause I Refuse To Let You Think You Can Play With My Mind
Always Seems That You Think That I'm Blind
Causes There Always Certain Times When Your Hard To Find
Your On The Go, I'm On The Go, Were On The Go
I Can't Catch You No More, Can't See You No More
And It No Longer Can Be Ignored
Cause At Once Upon A Time It Was You I Adored
You Disappeared And Left Me Here, Out In The Cold 
And The Absence Of You Is Hurting My Soul
Didn't Know There Was An End Of The Road
It Was So Easy For You Just To Let It All Go
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door
And I Refuse
No way i cant it baby
And I Refuse
No way i cant it baby
And I Refuse
No Way , But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore
Remember When I Told You I Could Feel The Change
You Don't Touch Me The Same, Don't Hold Me The Same
No, I Don't Want You To Take All The Blame
Cause I Know I Had Those Moments When I Caused The Pain
This Back And Forth Just Like A War With You And Me
See We Both Disagree, Have We Ever Agreed?
This Is Nothing Like I Thought It Would Be
Was It All Just A Dream? Was It Ever In My Reach?
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door
It Was Your Way
Or It Was No Way
And I Couldn't Live That Way
It Was Our Call
Then It Was Your Call
Cause I Gave You My All And All
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Have One More Sleepless Night
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let A Tear Fall From My Eye
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Try
I Felt Like I Would Die, If I Could Breakdown And Cry
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Walk Back Through That Door 
I Refuse,
I Refuse To Let You Hurt Me Anymore
And I Refuse,
I Refuse To Continue To Ignore
The Fact I Fell To The Floor, The Day You Walked Out My Door
No way i cant it baby
No way i cant it baby
No Way, But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore
No way i cant it baby
No way i cant it baby
No Way, But I Refuse
To Take It Anymore
I Refuse (I Refuse)
I Refuse (I Refuse)
And I Refuse (Ooooh)
And I Refuse (I Refuse)
I Refuse (Said I Refuse)
And I Refuse
Said I Refuse To Take It Anymore

Ohhhh no... ohh, oh... mmmm
Oh... ohhhh...
Maybe I'm just wrong for feelin the way I do
Thoughts indecent, want to put those down to you
I know you have a girl, I don't want to tie
When you're free one night just make those hours mine
I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright
Love just ain't my thang, but half of you might be
Enough for two or more, no her to me and me
Fine like expensive wine, drunk off one glass of you
I think more might be too much, so weekends for me are cool
I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright
I can be another woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side
That would alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright....[repeat until end]


We Ain't Lovers No More
We Don't Laugh No More
We Don't Play No More
We Don't Make-Up No More
We Don't Kiss No More
We Don't Hug No More
You Don't Please Me No More
You Don't Touch No More
Give Me Chills No More
We Don't Go Out No More
We Don't Kick It No More
We Don't Dance No More
I Remember 
Walking Through The Park
Just Shooting The Breeze
Kissing In The Shade
Those Were The Days
Lounging In The Den
Breakfast In the Bed
You Let Me Have My Way
Those Were The Days
If You Don't Want Me No More
Don't Come Round No More
Just Don't Call No More
Don't Come Knockin' Up At My Door
After Ten Or So
What You Knockin' For?
We Don't Kick It No More
You Ain't Cute No More
You Ain't Fly No More
You Ain't Got It Like That No More
See In Your Clothes You Don't
I Still Remember
Walking Through The Park
Just Shooting The Breeze
Kissing In The Shade
Those Were The Days
Lounging In The Den
Breakfast In the Bed
You Let Me Have My Way
Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
I Said Those Were The Days
I Said Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
Those Were The Days
What's Up With This Baby?
You Done Changed On Me (You Done Changed)
This Ain't The Way It Used To Be, Baby
You Don't Know Me No More 
You Can't Lie No More
Ain't Gon' Try No More
Won't Have To Say Goodbye No More
You Gotta Hit The Road
Hate To See You Go
I Ain't The One To Mess With No Flow
Don't Take Pictures No More
Don't Hold Hands No More
This Is The End Of The Road
But I Still Remember
Walking Through The Park
Just Shooting The Breeze
Kissing In The Shade
Those Were The Days
Lounging In The Den
Breakfast In the Bed
You Let Me Have My Way
Those Were The Days


What if.. every guy I saw

What if.. what would you say
What if.. what if, what if, what if
I hate a jealous man, one who doesn't understand
That I'm attractive so of course men wanna take my hand
And lead me off round the corner maybe to their place
But when they speak you get mad, jumping all up in my face
But on the other hand when women come and speak to you
You kiss and hug them like it's something that you let me do
You're only jealous cause you know the ish you put me through
I might turn right around and do that ish right back to you
What if.. every guy I saw

If you gonna cheat burn the receipt from the hotel room
But instead you're up in my face saying you were at friends
But they all call asking me where the hell you been
Why they keep treating us this way
I guess it's a little game we play
We'll burn you (oh), we'll cut you (oh)
We'll kill you (oh)
We don't have to take it no more

What would you do
To get to me
What would you say
To have your way
Would you give up
Or try again
If I hesitate
To let you win
Or would you be yourself
Or play your role
Tell all the boys
Or keep it low
If I say no
Would you turn away
Or play me off
Or would you stay[Chorus]
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again
I'm into you,
You into me
But I cant let it go
So easily
Not 'til I see
What this could be
Be eternity
Or just a week
You know, our chemistry
Is off the chain
Is perfect now
But will it change
This aint a yes
This aint a no
Just do your thang
We'll see how it goes...ohhh
If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try it again
You can dust it off and try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try it again
Dust yourself off and try again[Hook]
If you dont wanna throw it all away
Might be shy on the first date
What about the next date
huh, huh, huh, huh
If you dont wanna throw it all away
You might be buggin' on the first date
But what about the next date
um, um, um, um


[x2:]
I
I wanna love ya[Verse 1:]
Baby ever since I found you,
Seems like everyday I've been happy,
See the way you love me,
Turns me out, baby I can feel my heart beat,
Seems like lately I've been thinkin',
Feelin' that you are everything,
Feels like more and more,
I'm hoping that you are the only.[Chorus:]
All I need,
All I need,
All I need is you.
Baby you're everything,
Everything,
Everything is you.
Baby you're all I need,
All I need,
All I need is you.
Baby you're everything,
Everything,
Everything is you.[Verse 2:]
Baby usually when you do me,
Keepin' me straight,
Show me all your lovin',
Baby you're so amazing,
Never dreamed I'd be cravin' 2 be open,
Never thought it was a joke and
Didn't know I would realize real love,
And I'd been hopin',
That'd you,
Stay right here with me,
Give me all, give me all,
All the love I need,
Baby you're all, all I need.[Chorus]
I don't want nobody but you,
I don't need nobody but you,
Said I don't want nobody but you,
'Cause I don't love nobody but you.[x4:]
I
I wanna love ya[Chorus]


[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
(Said I need you)
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you[Verse 1]
Off to college
Yes, you went away
Straight from high school
You up and left me
We were close friends
Also lovers
Did everything
For one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back...to me
Can you...feel me (Callin')
Hear me...callin' (For you)
For you...'Cause it's[Chorus]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you[Verse 2]
Now I'm sittin' here
Thinkin' 'bout you
And the days we used to share
It's drivin' me crazy
I don't know what to do
I'm just wonderin' if you still care
I don't wanna let you know
That it's killin' me
I know you got another life you gotta concentrate baby
Come back...to me
Can you...feel me (Callin')
Hear me...callin' (For you)
For you...'Cause it's[Chorus 2x]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you[Bridge]
I...can't...be...no...more
Since you went away I
Don't really feel like talkin'
No one here to love me
Baby do you understand me
I can't do or be without you[Chorus 3x]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
(Tell me what I'm gonna do)
What am I gonna do?
Said I been needin' you, wantin' you
Wonderin' if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine?
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you


There’s no need for you,
Baby,
It ain’t what you think,
So don’t worry,[Verse 1]
You remember back in the day when,
We thought it was special,
When we always stayed down,
No matter where we went you’d stay in touch,
Two people that were just so in love,
Now you claiming that you feelin’ like things
Ain’t really been the way they used to be,
And you say it seems like I changed,
But I’m still the same.[Chorus (2X)]
There’s no need for you,
(To worry ‘bout me)
Baby,
(Don’t worry ‘bout me)
It ain’t what you think,
(You still got me)
So don’t worry,
(Don’t worry ‘bout, don’t worry ‘bout me)
Even though it seems,
(You’re losing me)
And things,
(Ain’t what they used to be)
Baby,
(I ain’t gonna leave)
Don’t worry,
(Don’t worry ‘bout, don’t worry ‘bout me)[Verse 2]
I was headin’ out to Cali,
For a show,
I told you that on Tuesday,
I’d be home,
Left a message on your voicemail
Sayin’ I’d call you later,
To inform you I’m alright,
Now you callin’,
Just to tell me that you heard,
I was seen in a Bentley with my girls,
So I’m on my way to a spot where people hang,
But nothing’s changed.[Chorus (2X)][Bridge]
There’s no need to
Worry ‘bout what
I do when I’m away.
(Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thing)
Don’t worry ‘bout what I do when I'm outta town,
(Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thing)
Don’t worry ‘bout how I do when I put it down,
(Don’t worry ‘bout a damn thing)
Trust in my everything’s gonna be alright,
Gonna work it out, be home tonight.[Chorus (2X)]

[ACAPELLA:]
Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know
Let me know[VERSE 1:]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You want to keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see[CHORUS:]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know. . .[VERSE 2:]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
what I say I'm all about, all about[CHORUS][BRIDGE:]
Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own)
Try and find another place for me
Cause. . .[CHORUS]
Ah, ah, ah - ha
See stay at your best baby

Went from my nigga serving it by the tele
To venues in Manchester just swerving with Balotelli
The fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassin'
They even bring up these niggas make the comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas gotta be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted?
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became somethin'
Girls that becoming ladies
And my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city
This shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This the shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Can't you talk to me
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby
Sometimes you are, all alone
But there's no doubt
So don't just shut me out
Cause that's not what love's about[Chorus:]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah
(Wassup)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaaaah

Came too far to give up
Gotta try, cause I can't do it on my own
Can't you talk to me
Tell me what you need
Can't you talk to me
Tell me what you need


Mhmm
Ohh, ohh
Yeah
Giving up, mm, is hard to do
When you really love someone
Giving up, so hard to do
When you still depend upon, his warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
Ooh, they used to mean so much, mm
And bring you happiness, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Giving up, so hard to do
I've tried, but it just ain't no use
Giving up, so hard to do
I said I've tried, but it just ain't no use
But my light of hope is burning dim
Oh but, mhmm, but in my heart I pray
That my love and faith in the man
Will ohh, will bring him back to me
Aye hey, aye hey
I'm talking 'bout if you really love somebody, heyy
Ooh, ooh, whether 
Whether he knows or not, hmm
He, he, he really needs me too
I said the man is all I got, oh, yes he is, yeah
And giving up, giving up is so hard to do
Oh, oh, oh, giving up, heyy
So hard to do, heyy, heyy, giving up
So hard for me to do
I said I've tried it, hey
Can't break through

Cause you mean so much to me, heyy
Ooh, giving up


Yeahhh.... Mmmm-hmm..... Whoaaaa.... Oooh yea...[1]
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone[2]
When we hooked up we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never ever leave us
That was a while ago
But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like all we do is fight
Every single night 
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back, take it way back
All the way back, can we start again
Do it over, can we straighten it out
Can we work it out, cuz...
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone[3]
I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you, be without you
I can't even breathe without you...
I can't feel with out you, deal without you, spend without you
My whole world is upside down...
Don't wanna go out cuz I can't ride without you
Feelin like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
Said I can't live...
Live without you, live without you
I can't go...
Go without you, go without you
Said I don't wanna be alone
Said I can't be... 
Be without you, be without you
Said I can't live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
Said I don't wanna be alone
How can this be (that it's not workin out)
That it's not workin out
We vowed to be always together
It's hurting me that we don't talk no more
It's not supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong
We both made mistakes, but gotta carry on
I don't wanna be... 
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna live, no.... No.....

Heart, don't fail me now!
Courage, don't desert me!
Don't turnback
Now that we're here
People always say
Life is full of choices
No one ever mentions fear!
Or how a road can seem so long
How the world can seem so vast
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey...to the past
Somewhere down this road
I know someone's waitingg
Years of dreams
Just can't be wrong
Arms will open wide
I'll be safe and wanted
Fin'lly home where I belong
Well, starting here, my life begins
Starting now, I'm learning fast
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
On this journey...to the past
Heart don't fail me now!
Courage don't desert me!
Home, Love, Family
There was once a time
I must have had them too
Home, Love, Family
I will never be complete
Until I find you...
One step at a time
One hope, then another
Who knows where
This road may go-
Back to who i was
On to find my future
Things my heartstill
Needs to know
Yes, let this be a sign!
Let, this road be mine!
Let it lead me to my past
Courage see me through
Heart I'm trusting you
To bring me home...
At last!
At Last!

Now he's dissing me cause he dissed you 
Can you believe the nerve of this dude? 
Cause of your memory I won't bring in the pistols 
But he got issues enough of that lame 
I never seen pain like your parents pain 
But I know God protecting you 
You used to read Seed Of The soul I know God perfecting you 
All the estrogen the darker texture you are the more intellectual

We feel your presence just not in the physical 
All across the world, blocks is miserable 
Y'all left a void it's alot of little yous 
But they not original and they not identical 
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews 
That's when hip hop if it's not ten of you 
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws 
Footprints on the game hood ain't been the same 
Feeling ain't been in music hooks ain't been the same 
But I'm doing what I can man and try to follow y'all memory lane man 
Big you be ashamed to see New York gangbang 
Pac you feel the same thing they use your name in vein 
But I guess that's the issue 
And it proves how much, niggas really miss you [Outro: Jay-Z (Aaliyah)]
Pun we missing you Big L we missing you

Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you)

Soldiers and soldgettes all across the world (I miss you) 
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all live in our memories forever

Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you 
Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you


It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
No days go by I'm thinking of you
And no way can I forget the things you do[repeat]
You're on my mind all day and night
You're all I'm thinking of the way you treat me right
My days with you are here no more
We had some good days I know for sure[chorus]
No days go by I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget( I can't get you off my mind)
The thing you do[repeats]
We've got a special thing I never could explain
Straight up the way I feel it doesn't seem real
I never meant to hurt you don't go nowhere
Cause you know this heart I'll always share
You said your love was true but I don't see that
You left me alone broke up this happy home
Why'd you have lie
No days go by I'm not thinking of you
And no way can I forget ( you are always on my mind)
The thing you do
My love
And on and on and on


[Verse 1]
Hey there, you nasty boy, it’s been a minute
And I could say my life has changed since you hit it
This is your strongest trait, you worked a miracle
While they say I’m sprung, I say "Baby, you did it"[Hook]
They say you a baller, I hear you’re just a player
And all my friends tell me I should have never dated
But now I’m in love with you and I’mma have to tell ‘em
Quit hatin’ on him, don’t be jealous[Bridge]
(Your world, your world)
I’m into you boy, it can be
(Your world, your world)
Boy this don’t mean that I gotta be
(Your girl, your girl)
Had to take my friend home
My girls, nowhere without my girls, baby[Verse 2]
Hey, first I seen you in a Beamer, and then I saw the Lexus
I knew about the Benzes, with the 20-inch rims on ‘em
And a lot of ex-girlfriends, I bet they still calling
Well I can’t say I blame ‘em, cause you have something[Hook][Bridge][Bridge][Hook]


Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
A special smile, a certain touch
I never had a love that I loved so much
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there
My very best friend, my summer day
My only someone to depend on
When I've lost my way
You came and answered my every prayer
Turn the page, you were there
What would I do if some strange morning
I opened up my eyes to find you gone
I can't imagine how I would survive it
I finally got the reason to go on
My one sure thing, my solid ground
All I ever wanted was the love that we found
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there, yeah
What would I do if strange morning
I opened up my eyes to find you gone
I can't imagine how I would survive it
I can't imagine how I would go on
A special smile, a certain touch
I never had a love that I loved so much
When I look back, you're everywhere
Turn the page, you were there
You came and answered my every prayer
Turn the page, you were there
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, ooh


[Intro - Missy Elliott]
I've been around the world (mmmmm)
And I still can't find my baby
See I searched high and low
And I still...still can't find my baby[Verse 1 - Aaliyah]
(Ashame) It's ashame (shame, shame)
That I've searched the sky, high and low
Still can't find my baby..
Where could he (where could he be at?)
Where, could he be? (where could he be?)
Let me walk the streets
Through snow and sleet
Until I find my baby, baby[Chorus:]
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye
Is he seein another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die?
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi[Verse 2:]
(Oh) It's a crime (crime, crime)
When you take this poor heart of mine
Use it for a rug to walk on (a rug to walk on)
Then you're gone (gone)
Then right out my life for the last time
I'm gonna find my baby, baby[Chorus:]
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi (ay-yi-yi)
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye (he didn't say goodbye)
Is he seein another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die? (until I die-die-die-die)
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi[Hook:]
Why can't
You call me?
Dial me
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Why can't
You call me?
Dial me
Yeah-yeah[Chorus (repeat 2x)]
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi
I can't find my baby
Packed his clothes and didn't say good-bye
Is he with another lady?
Should I search this earth til' I die?
Or let it drive me crazy?
Been around the world and ay-yi-yi[Outro (Tweet):]
I keep searchin' and searchin'!

[Verse 1:]
I'm a lady that comes with no chances
That means if I spot a sign of trouble your gone
To many times before, seemed I always played the fool
How was I to know, I was young and Gullible
I let the guys play my heart as if it was a toy
I got respect for me, now is a new day[Pre-chorus:]
I'm gonna let you play the games on me
Because I got a better strategy
And if you ever cause depression whoa,
Then you'sa gotta go, go, go[Chorus:]
I'ma fight the tears so my make-up, don't mess up
And I'ma fight the feelings I be wantin to call you
And I'ma fight you back, if you ever step to me,
Closin up the doors
Made it clear before, 
Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)[Verse 2:]
Don't get me wrong I don't hate men,
I love 'em, but I just think that some should stop their problems
Some are confusers, users, abusers, 
Some are just plain 'ol losers
Boy your silly games won't get away with me
I'm not the foolish girly that I used to be
Chuck it out the window, just like that
If your head is 'posed to be where it's at

Do me wrong, you go
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)
'Cause I'm a fighter (whoa)[Bridge:]

Theres fishes in the sea

Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My man has found another, and gone away
With him went my future, my life is filled with gloom,
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange,
But I wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause so badly
I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)
but I cant go no I can't let him see me cryin'
But listen, I got to cry, cuz crying, ooooooooh,
Is the pain, oh yeah
you know people, this hurt I feel inside,
Words, they, could never explain,
I wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooooooh baby
Let it rain (rain, rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain
Day in and day out, my tears stained face
Pressed against my window pane
My eye search the skies, well, desperately for rain
Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops and no one will ever know
That I'm crying (crying) crying (crying)
When I go outside
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain,
I just wish it would rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Rain, rain, rain (oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooooh baby
Let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Yeah, You know I'm a man, I ain't got no pride,
Til it rains, I'm gonna stay inside,
Let it rain, Let it rain
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh how I wish that it would rain...


If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me, yeah
You know I tried to treat you right
But, you stay out, stay out every night
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin
Bring it on home to me.
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Baby, bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
I'll give you lovin and money too
That ain't all, all I do for you,
Baby if you bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, oh honey
You know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me.
But I forgive you, yeah


Looking out on the morning rain 
I used to feel uninspired 
And when I knew I had to face another day 
Lord, it made me feel so tired 
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind 
But your love was the key to peace my mind 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman 
When my soul was in the lost-and-found 
You came along to claim it 
I didn't know just what was wrong with me 
Till your kiss helped me name it 
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for 
Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman 
Oh, baby, what you've done to me 
You make me feel so good inside 
And I just want to be close to you 
You make me fell so alive 
Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like 
A natural woman


Like the treble and the reverb
We go good together babe
Treble and the reverb oh
We go good together babe
Treble and the reverb oh oh oh
We go good together babe
Treble and the reverb oh
We go good together baby


[Verse 1:]
Empty pizza boxes on the floor
Empty liquor bottles from before
You'll find your comfort in between the sheets
Way to afraid to take it to the streets
Confidence just went out the window
So down can't get up can't move no more
Life is passing by and your poor soul is gone ooh[Chorus: x2]
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up
Get Up
(Get Up)
Get out of bed.
Stop wasting time[Verse 2:]
Say that you'll do it the next day
Then in rolls the year 2008
Still procrastinating
Your work is overdue
Say that you'll buy a big house
But you ain't got sh! t right now
Disappointed cause you said that change was gonna
COME
COME
COME
OOOOOH[Chorus: x2]
Wake Up (Wake Up)
Wake Up
Get Up
Get Up

Tell me if you hear me
Tell me if you're listening oh
If you understand say...[Chorus: x2]

You think you sleep
Staying out at night
But you know damn right you is wrong
You’re running all over town
While your man waits around
At home thinking that you’re with your girl
But he don’t know
That you out here, making him look like a fool no
No, no he don’t know
That you out here doing him dirty
He don’t know
Another man is giving his lady love
He don’t know
Cause if he did he’d kick you out that door
You said Bob’s your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know you’re somebody’s wife
Now what makes you think
That the birdies won’t sing?
About all of them secrets you hold
You ho-old
Whatever goes up
Must come back down
Shit like this always hits the ground
But he don’t know
That you out here, making him look like a fool no
No, no he don’t know
That you out here doing him dirty
He don’t know
Another man is giving his lady love
He don’t know
Cause if he did he’d kick you out that door
You said Bob’s your uncle
Terry is your cousin
Bruce is your brother
So is Kevin
Say uh uh uh uh uh
You keep on telling them lies
I say uh uh uh uh uh
You know you’re somebody’s wife
So we’re talking

Remember the days when we used to chill
We didn't have a care in the world
We used to laugh together
Blaze it up and walk 'round the creek
Reminiscing on the time
When we used to skip class together
I could never forget ooooh
Never forget my good friends
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back to the day when we used to play
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back to the day when we used to play
He-e-ey. Oooh.
Take me back, take me back oh yeah
Yeah Oh!
Summertime, weather was hot as hell
I swear it ain't hot like it used to be
Back then the music was fire
Why did I had to go leave and retire?
Reminiscing on the time
When things were much better way back then
I could never forget uh
Never forget the time spent oh oh
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Just for a moment, a moment back in time
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me
Can we go back? I wanna go back
When we were so young and our hearts would run free
Can we go back? I wanna go back
I heard it's foolish to say
That things were better back in the day
But I swear it ain't the same
You know that I gotta roll with the change
But can we go back?
Just one time
You and I
Can we go back?
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Take me back just one time
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Can we?
Can we go back? I wanna go back
When we were so young oh oh oh
Can we go back? I wanna go back
Can weeeee?
Woaahhhhhhhh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


If you ask me
What our love’s all about
I would say our love is like a flower
With the petals pulled out
No one to try to put us down baby
Because I love you too much and 
You love me too but
There’s just some problems that we gotta work through time
There’s not much time
We gotta get it together today
Because tomorrow man, you never know
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
Bittersweet memories
Of how we used to be
I know right now we’re still together
But the fire and passion is gone
It’s killing me
Every day
Because our love ain’t the same
And every night I pray please God don’t take my baby away
Oh time
There’s not much time
We gotta get it together today
Because tomorrow man, you never know
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
Can we get it back like
Get back the fire
Burning love again
You used to hold me real close
And I didn’t let go of you, just held on tight
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away
You used to hold me real close
And I didn’t let go of you, just held on tight
But nowadays it feels like slowly
Your love is fading far away
Fire burning love


These days, the back of my mind
Lately I’ve been thinking
About the thing that you di back then
‘Bout all them girls, now you mess with them
Know I forgave you but I can’t forget
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
Back of my mind
Whenever I look up in the sky I’m like
Count the stars
It amounts to all the teardrops from my eyes
Oh yes it does
And it hurts 
Cause I love you
And this shit just won’t go away
It’s in my head
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
It stays in the back of my mind (back of my mind, back of my mind)
Back of my mind
I tried to forget it
I tried
But it just won’t leave me alone
I wanna move on
But it just stays, stays in the back of my mind
Oh it stays, stays in the back of my mi-mi-mi-mi-mind


Hey Mr. Heartbreaker
Do me a favor
Stop making me cry
Cause I feel I ain't strong no more
I need you to stop right now
Cause it feels like I'm sinking down
With my pockets full of stones
And a brick tied around my soul
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Hey Mr. Heartbreaker
You know I used to be a fighter
But ever since you came into my life
I can't find what's wrong from right
Oh you took the hope out of me
I can't find any joy in anything
And all of the things that I used to enjoy
I don't enjoy them no more
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
Everybody's wondering
Where she go
The girl that they used to know
She don't live here no more
She's gone
She's gone
She's gone
Uuh uuh I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the same


And I'm guessing you still think I still got them
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
Like a coin to a packer with a hole
We were like them, nothing less, nothing more
Here's your 50 cent, fine! You can keep it
Cause you are a little late and your pockets is empty
You used to be my wind and I was your dust
I'll follow you everywhere you could thrust
The end of the day comes night
Now I know wrong from right
I remember the night you was walking
Hand in hand with that flimsy girl
And you made sure I'd end up feeling like it's my fault
It took some time to open up my eyes
Now the grass is surely greener on the other side
I'm glad that I can say, I got this fool out my mind
And I'm guessing you still think I still got them
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
I need a boy, lookin lookin at my phone
Hopping, praying you could call it
It got too quiet so ended up falling falling falling
Sunken down, sunken down
An di was here to 11, and now you're expecting
For me to come around cause what we had was profound
You don't miss your water until it runs dry
Never like before, you had me wrong with your lies
And I'm guessing you still think I still got that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
And I'm guessing you still think you got it like that
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
All the pictures, all the letters, all the memories of you
I burned it up, I burned it up, I burned it
Sitting at the fireplace
Forgetting everything I did in them old days
To be honest I was a little clueless
Didn't know that you'd end up being so heartless
I was mess when you left
After all the stress babe, they should put you under arrest
Now you're over here thinking you could get it back
Look at you, still thinking you want that
I tell you what... you can kiss my ass


She’s ambitious
Man, and she’s vicious
Really beautiful
I never thought in my life I would never do it again
But now I do
She had a mission
She had a vision
To be with my man
I could swear that I could see the twinkle in her eyes
She had a plan
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other way
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
He’s so faithful
I’m so grateful he belongs to me
She’s tried so many times
But in the end she always finds it
Hard, too much all over me
I’m losing patience
She will be facing
Me very soon
If she don’t stop
Somebody better call the cops 
Cause I’ll go swinging
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other way
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
She’s the one playing with her hair
Walking ‘round like she don’t care
She’s the one that sprinkles all the trouble in the air
She’s the type that likes to mess around with other ladies’ guys
That’s Miss Lovely
She’s Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
You’d better look the other way
Cause I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Look the other way
I’ll take that pretty smile
And I’ll turn that pretty smile into a frown
Hey Miss Lovely
Hey Miss Lovely
Look the other way
I’ll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile
I’ll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile
I’ll take that pretty smile
And turn that pretty smile into a frown
Miss Lovely


The man at the door, 6 foot 4
Just told me that I can’t get in
He said that it was closing
But he was only lying
‘Cause it was only open for his friends
I came to have a good time
Wanted to spin my edge, Yes I did
But had me feeling like I wasn’t good enough to come in
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
The girl with the smoky eyes dipped in the skewer reminiscing over mocking birds
She’s a birdie that likes to mock and just talks talks talks
That messed up
Oh, she doesn’t gets it
Because she thinks she perfect
And everyone to rock will think she’s right
Well let me tell you something
That karma is a bitch
And when it comes to rock 
You’re gonna feel that chick
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
The cast outs, the bullied arounds
The ones that got chased out of town
The cats that always got put down
The longer they’re away, they come back around
I promise you’re gonna see your better days
I promise it won’t always be this way
So let them fools believe that they could
Cause one day they’re gonna walk in your shoes
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang
Hey big boy I guess you’ve got your cool shoes on
I see you with your friends, you’re rocking the same trend as them
Hey bubbly girl, I guess you’ve got your cool shoes
Sucks that ain’t cool enough to hang your clan, ah dang


I sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
Why you complainin?
What's it to you?
You ain't even been through the things that I've been through
You don't know me,
Hell, I don't know you
Stop tryna tell me what I should and shouldn't do
You got your own lives
Stop focusing on mine
I can do what the hell I like
Baby don't waste your time
Sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give a shit about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
They say she was pregnant, they say she was fat
They say she was ugly, as she ain't know that
She don't suit the haircut, I think she's a try hard
I don't like the music and I think she's stupid
Damn, you people got so much to say
I wonder if you're strong enough to take my place
Sit with a slouch
Whatever I do, I do it for myself
Sit with a slouch
Don't give two shits about what comes out your mouth
Sit with a slouch
Why should a change?
I do what feels comfortable
Sit with a slouch
I sit with a slouch
I never thought it would be that hard
Doing what I really love
All my life all I wanted to do was this nothing at all
This is my life, you can't take it
No, you bitches can't break it
None of you haters can replace it
None of you haters can take it from me
This is my life
This is my life
This is my, my, my life


Every night I sit by the window
Crying like a wolf cause your love's gone
I didn't mean it when I said that I hate you
Know that I love you
And even if you don't love me anymore
Then I'll just be here, sitting, crying tears on the floor
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying for you you you
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'm thinking to myself – who's loving you now?
The thought of another is making me break down
I didn't mean it when I said it's over
Please don't say it's over
And even if you don't love me anymore
Then I'll just be here, sitting, crying tears on the floor
Forever and ever my heart will always remain with you
And I'll be crying for you you you
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
I'll be crying like a wolf
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Howling at the moon and I hope that you can hear my call
Come back to me
Said come back to me
That's the sound of the beat of my heart, boom boom
Hoping that you will hear my call
I'm howling at the moon, I hope you hear me baby
Hear me baby


If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Hey, woke up today
Realized that things just ain't the same
For me and you, I was confused
But now my screws ain't really that loose
After all this time, made up my mind
This relationship wasn't really that tight
You were Mr. Wrong when I needed Mr. Right
Somewhere down the line you lost that body
Cause every day is a battle when it comes to love
You gotta put up a fight
When it comes, when it comes to love
You don't just give up your trying
I've been trying for too long
To get you to hold on
But I guess you, you don't love me anymore
If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
Shameless, a damn shame the things I do end up this way
Stay awake got nothing to say
Acting like you ain't really that phased
But I swear baby in time
You 'bout to find that missing piece of mine
And when you find that I'm off to the next one
I'll be singing something about my new one
Saddest thing is loving
Loving someone who
Who used to love me
Saddest feeling is knowing how
How good it used to be
I gotta let go of memories
That keep me from leaving
Cause you don't, you don't love me anymore
If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
I'm done with pretending that we're alright
I can't keep on fronting, I don't wanna lie, anymore
I'm outta door, I'm looking for a better lover
That can make my heart smile
See that's what you used to do
But now you actin like you ain't got nothing to lose
I'm a make it easy for you
I'm a be the first to say it
Darling, I think we're through
If you don't love me I will find another
That will love me, that will love me better
They say love is blind but baby all I see
Is you don't love me anymore
No, you don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore
You don't love me anymore


And the reverb
We go good together baby oh oh oh
We go good together babe oh oh oh
We go good together babe
Like the treble and the reverb yea
We go good together babe

I don't know what to do 
I can't believe it's true that 
You can make me feel this way 
I see it in your eyes 
It made me realize 
There's something that I've got to say 
I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry 
For all the things I've done to make you worry 
And all the time I've cared for you from the bottom of my heart 
I will be yours if you'll be mine 
I will be there till the end of time 
I will be with you until the day that I die 
I'll be yours. I'll be yours 
I've been around the world 
And have seen a lot of girls 
But n one can compare to you 
It's really plain to see 
That you belong to me 
Cause you're the only one I need.

I can tell that you've been hurt 
By that look on your face girl 
Some guy brought safety to your happy world 
You need love but you're afraid that if you give in 
Some one else will come along 
And sock it to you again 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard 
I could make you happy baby and satisfy you too 
But how can I when you won't give me a chance to prove my love to you 
Won't you give me just one little chance 
I give you my guarantee that you won't be hurt again 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard 
I've been noticing you baby for long, long time 
I'm not ashamed to tell the world that you really messed up my mind 
Girl, to me you're like a dream come true 
I would rather hurt myself then to ever hurt you 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch 
Ooooo, give it one more try before you give up on a love 
One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl 
Ooooo, I don't care what they say I care what you've heard.

I remember the day we met 
Almost like a fairy tale 
Kinda like Romeo and Juliet 
I never gonna forget 
Now my knees went weak 
When you said "hi" 
And then you held my hand 
And look me in the eye 
I almost died, deep inside 
There's so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I never learned myself 
I wanna do what you want me to do 
I want you and no one else 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
I heard about how wonderful love can be 
But in my mind I never could have dreamed 
Such a fantasy 
Maybe it's destiny 
I share myself with you in a special way 
I'm not a little boy 
I never gonna leave you 
And I'm gonna say 
That everything is okay 
There's so much love 
That I don't understand 
That I never learned myself 
I wanna do what you want me to do 
I want you and no one else 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me how) 
Tell me how to love you, baby girl 
I want you to tell me how (how) 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x] 
Tell me how to make you smile (tell me) [3x]
Tell me how to make you smile.

Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Action, your body activates freedom 
Your mind excellerates passion 
The time has come to get wild 
Rise up and follow fusion 
Our youth is just an illusion 
Let's start a revolution 
Explore the corridores 
We'll find our restitution 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Music, it's all around and you choose it 
To take control or you lose it 
Your way to find an escape from dancing to this song 
Power, minutes turned into hours 
Now's the time to get louder 
The light is there to be seen you're dreamin', no you've gotta 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
We've travelled so far 
To explore the mysteries of life 
And the reality of our youth 
Is overlooked by those who restrict our freedom 
Our freedom of expression, our freedom to get wild 
This is Aaron and this is my world 
And it's yours 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Listen, they're callin' you but you're missin' 
You're standin' off in position 
A crowded room is in rage 
I'm up on stage fire 
You say you wanna go higher up and fly away you're gone, 
Ain't nothing wrong with standin', I'm commandin' you to 
Stop... everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild 
Everybody get wild.


I'd do anything for you 
We've had our good times and bad 
Baby what is sad 
I miss you girl 
Oh yes I do 
Now that you're gone ...away 
It's hard for me to say 
I miss you girl 
Oh yes I do 
I just want you to know 
That the love I have is real 
But girl I really want to show you how I feel 
I'd do anything 
To be with you again 
Just name the place 
And I will be there, I will be there 
Oh tell me why can't I 
Have the one I love 
Just like the way it used to be 
I miss you all of the time 
When you were mine 
I miss the way it seemed so right 
How could I let the girl I love 
Slip right through my hands 
I can't get you off my mind 
I just want to make you happy 
I want to make you understand 
I need you for my girlfriend 
Until the very end 
Oh I miss holding hands and playing games 
I get chills when I hear your name 'cuz I know 
It'll never be the same 
I'd do anything 
Just to be with you 
I'll tell you that I love you 
If you want me to 
Just call my name 
And I'll be there 
To let you know how much I care 
Oh... baby...


My mama told me I'm too young to love 
But I know what I know and I can't get enough 
I'm thinking about you and me holding hands 
Pushing you on a swing 
We can do anything 
Cause when I think of you all I know 
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart 
I often wonder the meaning of love 
Is it something meant just for grown-ups? 
Nick always told me just to follow my dreams 
But with love on my mind it is so hard to see 
And still when I think of you all I know 
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart 
It's true if I'm wrong 
Then tell me girl what should I do 
Or would you even care 
If I told you love could be so simple 
Between me and you 
Oh, baby 
Ain't that cute - holding hands in the park 
Ain't that cute - can't stay late after dark 
Ain't that cute - was in love from the start 
Ain't that cute - I could swear you stole my heart.


You found out 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
You must have heard it from my best friend 
She's always talkin' when she should be listening 
Can't keep a secret to save her life 
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside 
I never knew a rumour could spread so fast 
But now the word is out all over town 
That I'm longing for you 
How did you know cause I never told 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
No more charades my heart's been displayed 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
Maybe I was the one who left a trace 
Was there a message written on my face 
Were my emotions so easily read 
That you would know my thoughts before a word was said 
Was it my eyes that let you know you had control 
Because the way you move was so self-assured 
You knew I would surrender 
How did you know cause I never told 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
No more charades my heart's been displayed 
You found out I've got a crush on you 
You found out I've got a crush on you.


Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
You stood out amongst the crowd 
And I was left without a doubt 
That you were meant for me 
So romanced was I by you 
One dance and then I knew 
That I could fall in love, oh yeah 
Oh baby won't you swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing it out, girl swing it out, girl swing it [7x]
I have never known before 
A girl I wanted more 
The way I want you now 
I admit you are the best 
And with you I am obsessed 
And could never do without 
Oh baby, won't you swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out 
I, I like to watch you when you dance 
(When you, watch you when you dance) 
And tonight don't you make any other plans 
Unless you're making them with me 
Swing it, swing it, swing it (2x) 
Swing, swing it out, swing it out 
Swing it baby let me know that you mean what you say 
When you swing it all the way 
Now baby, swing it out.


..He's here..[Laughing]
What are you doin' tonight?
Man, I got this big test tomorrow that I got to study for...
EHHHH...wrong!
Your partyin' with me tonight
Party? Where?
At my house,
It's going to be the 
party of the century
everone's going to be there
How do you plan on getting your parents out of the house?[Record scratch]
Hmm..Good question...


[Talking:]
Here's a little bit of old school for ya, 
That goes a little something like this...
I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(Throw the party of the month)
No, the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
(No, send them to a show)
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though
I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...
The door bell rings cuz the party's here
I'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years
Walkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man
(Nobody can do it like Aaron can)
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' out the moves like it's MTV
I'm guessin' where I'm goin' cuz I lost my head
Then I jumped on table, this is what I said
People all around you gotta 
(Come get it) 
Everyone together sing it loud 
(Come get it) 
Jump all around, come on 
(Come get it) 
What...
(Come get it)
Say it again
(Come get it)
People all around you gotta
(Come get it)
From the left to the right, make noise
(Come get it)
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what 
Na na na na... Na na na na...
Things are goin' great 
Then to my surprise
Some people walked in, I didn't recognize
I said fellows, yo, ya gotta get out
(Hey man I heard this was an open house) 
Open house?
(Yeah that's what the flyers said)
Well I didn't put out flyers
(Well somebody did)
Then walked in
The girl I'm crushin'
And the kid spilled juice
On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and 
Another kid broke the lamp 
(I hope they weren't expensive)
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it
I'll clean it up later 
There's a honey over there
And I really wanna meet her
People all around you gotta
(come get it) 
Everyone together sing it loud
(come get it) 
Jump all around come on
(come get it) 
What?
(come get it)
Say it again here we go, uh
(come get it) 
People all around you gotta
(come get it) 
From the left to the right, make noise
(come get it) 
Here we go now, come on
Uh uh what what
Aaron C's in the house, here we go 
Come with it
Break it down
(go go go go go...)
Is that a car door
Oh dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now
On the double 
I'm dead (your done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout this party I had
I don't wanna even start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin around the house 
Trying to clean up the mess
I sure put my new white Nikes to the test
The car door slammed
And they're walking up the steps
I guess life is good with 10 seconds left 
(AARON!!!???!!!) 
Grounded[Chorus]
Aaron C's in the house, come on 
(come get it)
Uh uh what what[Fades...]


I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
She's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
Go to see her when the sun goes down
Ain't no finer girl in town
You're my girl, what the doctor ordered
So sweet, you make my mouth water
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
I want candy
Candy in the morning time,
Candy in the hot sunshine.
Candy baby can't you see,
All I want is your candy!
Candy in the morning time,
Candy in the hot sunshine.
Candy baby can't you see,
All I want is your candy!
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
All I want is your candy!
(Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey)
All I want is your candy!


I wanna see ya bounce
Welcome to the party 
This is one of a kind
Like a hot chilli pepper
It'll blow your mind
Don't know if you can take it
So now we're gonna shake it
And if you can't
getcha in house arrest
It's like this 
We've got the crazy notion
DJ's treating us with a jumpin' potion
So come on everybody throw your hands in the air
Oh yeah
Ya gotta get up
to get it down
(Come on, come on)
When the beat kicks in
and you feel the scream
Just don't stand around
Are you ready to jump
Gonna funk around
??
Let the fun begin
Don't stop now cause I wanna see ya bounce[Chorus]
Livin' it up
Cause we're here to party
With a bouncey, bouncey
Gonna make you happy
Playin' the disco bongo with me
And a bouncey, bouncey
Come dance with me[X2]
Stop the tracks
Can't you see it's not enough
Find the bliss
And he's coming on tough
They say turn it down
What'd ya say
No way
The sounds are pumpin'
From the DJ
Crank it up
Cause we're gonna ??
The original Millenium

Ain't no doubt about it
I can't wait to get home to you
(I gotta get home, yeah, uh, uh, come on.)
Connected with my baby
Just jammin online with you
(online, online, online)
Here in my room we are as one
(together you and me, together you and me)
Hours connect
As we switch on (switch on)[Chorus]
She's my best kept secret
My internet girl (my internet girl)
She's my one and only
And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl)
She's my best kept secret
Hooked up all night with that girl
(my internet girl)
She's my one and only, my internet girl
(my internet girl)
My internet girl, my internet girl.
Shufflin' through my windows
Gotta find my way back to you
(I gotta find away, gotta find a way)
(I gotta find a way, gotta find a way)
You left me mail in the inbox
Thinkin' about what we should do
(I will type again girlfriend, so tell me, tell me what you wanna do)
You left me the password to your heart
(yeah, that's it. I got it.)
No lookin' back we clicked from the start
I wanna let you know
She's mine[Chorus X2. fade]


And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this 
Hit It!
Aaron's in the house
Come on
Get up get up
I wanna make it bounce
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
Aaron's in the house
Yo guys, check it out
Guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball
Working on my game
(Yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow
It was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquile O'Neal
(What? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, do you wanna play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad
Try not to cry
(Please Aaron, are you for real?)
(One-on-one with Shaquile O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 Centre from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous)
I knew I could take him
Stared' at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes... [CHORUS]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
Cuz that's how I beat Shaq[X2]
So check it out
I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks
Was he hitting those shots?
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, that I could change the pace
I said, Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess your getting nervous
Cuz you already lost[CHORUS]
Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man[X2]
Announcers were shocked
Couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up
I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
but the ball went in
Then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too
And we can still be friends
The fans went nuts
They put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice
And it sounded like my mother's
(Get up for school, you're gonna be late!)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing the game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal?
Woah...[CHORUS]


[Chorus 1]
3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Slap
Clap Pat! Clap your hand...

Clap Slap! Clap your hand...
Slap your thigh and sing a little song[Chorus 2]
My mama told me if I was lucky
That she would treat me
If I was goody
My Aunty told her, I shoulda told her
No I'm not kidding
That's what she told her
3, 6, 9
The goose drank wine 
The monkey chew tobacco on the streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked 
And they all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Clap Clap! 
Clap your hands and prepare to Pat
Take your right arm 
Pat your partner?r palm with your right palm

Take your hand to your palm and slap your thigh 
And watch the fun materialize 
As you sing this little song: [Chorus 2]
(whisper)[Chorus 1][Chorus 2 (x2)]
That's what she told her
I don't believe It
Yeah right
Can you believe it?[Chorus 1]


My grandma and your grandma
Were sittin' by the fire.
My grandma told your grandma
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire" [Chorus:]
Hey now! Hey now!

My flag boy and your flag boy
Were sittin' by the fire.
My flag boy told your flag boy
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire"[Chorus]
See that guy all dressed in green ?
Iko Iko unday 
He's not a man He's a lovin' machine.
Jockamo fee nan?[Chorus x 2][Fade to end]


[Talking:]
Sometime, someplace
Everybody has words
Fallin' out, and making up
Uh-huh[Chorus]
Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal
But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, adjusting to the sound
You and I get, everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time
(Yeah, yeah)
1, 2, 3, 4
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane
You and I have much to give
Everything is relative
When we have our darker days
We just go our seperate ways
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane[Chorus]
Sometimes baby in your eyes
Love is truely justified
When I hear you tellin' lies
I just wanna terorize
Making up is oh so good
Yeah we rock the neighbourhood
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane[Chorus]
(la la la la la la la)[Chorus]


Are you tired, of me
Do you want to, be free
I just got to know
Should I hang on, or let go
Don't keep me guessing
It just ain't fair
You got me drowning in a sea of despair
I've held up for as long as I can
Ohhh I need to know, am I still your man[Chorus]
Tell me what you want
Tell me what your gonna do
Na na na na
Tell me what you want
Tell me what I have to do
Na na na na na na
Putting pressure, on my heart
Maybe we need some time apart
We need to find out what's gone wrong
Before the love's completely gone
I've held up for as long as I can
I need to know am I still your man
I'll be past the point, of no returns
Is there a reason to be concerned[Chorus]
Give me a chance 
to say what's left of my pride
Please tell me girl
Is the grass greener on the other side[Chorus]


I see you every day
and I can't seem to think
of anything to say
Do you baby
How can that be
that it breaks my heart 
when you're smilin at me
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true[CHORUS]
Girl you shine like reflections on the water
Girl you shine like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you Shine like that stars in the sky
In you I see something I won't find ever again
Baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart
The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one to make my dreams come true[REPEAT CHORUS][BRIDGE]
Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're gonna make my dream come true
You know I never would leave you
I'll never deceive you
I'll give you every piece of my heart
Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl you shine(shine)
Shine(shine)
Shine on me
Girl You shine(shine)
Shine(shine)

[Aaron:] Well, I guess the best way for me to begin is
The Other day I was hanging with some friends
Going around the room talking about our favorite noise
I said I had a brother in the Backstreet Boys
So everyone screamed[Group of Kids:] Hey is this some kinda trick[Dopey Guy:] Yea, which one is he?[Aaron:] The Blonde One, Nick
Then the cutest girl said:[Girl:] I have to see their show
But I have no ticket, Aaron
How can I go[Aaron:] Your wish is my command
See it's no problem, hon
In fact I'll get some tickets here for everyone
All I gotta is pick up the celly
And its a done deal
Let me call Nick and tell him[Other Guy:] By the way Aaron, if you could, while you're at it
Can you hook up some seats
For my friends and my parents?[Aaron:] So I said to myself, well heck, why not?
There's nothing that can beat the connection I got[Chorus (girls):] Aaron, Oh Aaron
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
([Aaron:] man)
How gonna make them come true?
([Aaron:] I don't know)
Aaron, Oh Aaron,
What are we going to do with you?
Always a makin' a bigger mistake
Always a-makin' a fool
([Aaron:] Yo, I gotta make a phone call)[Ring][Nick:] Hello?[Aaron:] Hey Nick
I need a favor from you, dude
I promised people tickets
So you gotta come through[Nick:] Sure, bro...how many do you need?[Aaron:] 1...2...uh, 3003[Nick:] WHAT?!
I can get you maybe a dozen
You can't promise seats to everyone and their cousin
What did you do? 
How'd you get in this mess?[Aaron:] I was talkin to this girl...[Nick:] Hold your breath
I know the rest
Guess you better get yourself a whole lotta money[Aaron:] For 3000 tickets?
Nick, that's isn't funny.
How'm I supposed to pull that off in so little time?[Nick:] You got me, Aaron
That's your problem...not mine[Chorus (girls):] Aaron, Oh Aaron
([Aaron:] What do I do?)
What are you going to do?
You make empty promises oh so big
([Aaron:] What?)
How gonna make them come true?
Aaron, Oh Aaron, 
([Aaron (annoyed):] What?)
What are we going to do with you?
([Aaron:] I don't know)
Always a makin' a bigger mistake 
([Aaron:] So, it was just one mistake)
Always a-makin' a fool
([Aaron:] Whatever)[Aaron:] How in the world can he do that to me?
I thought we were blood.
I thought we were family.
We're gettin' to the show
We'll get good seats
Everyone on the bus, you're all coming with me
I'm tellin' you guys when we get to the gate
He can never say "no" when he looks at my face
Hook me up! Nick, Man, I swear I'll pay you back[Nick:] Well come to think about, we need an opening act.[Aaron:] What do you want me to do: tell jokes; dance; act?[Nick:] Nah, I want you on stage, I want you to rap. 
'Cause if you don't you're gonna have some disappointed friends
And by the way you're on at eight, that's when the show begins[Chorus (girls):] Aaron. Oh, Aaron, what are you going to do?

You make big promises oh so big
How you gonna make it come true?

Yo my man. Get behind the wheels
Time to cruise. You snooze, you lose
Let me introduce you to my friends
In the other car right behind us
And my other friends in the car
Right behind them, start a Caravan
Crank it up and let it pump
We're gonna make a kriss kross jump
It's the drivin' anthem
And when it's time to hit the road
Feel the heat, crash
Ready to explode

Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio

We need atleast 10 rows
As we roll east
And then it's time to
Go to the Backstreet show
Or the Britney Spears show
Cuz it's starring me, yo
We'll be in the crowd
Hypin' up the party
I want the best reception
For each and everybody
So when I hit the stage
Show me love, don't be rude
And afterwards get my brother
Burn rubber dude
When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me didiyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so
Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all

Everybody come and follow me
That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up
That's not the way to rock
Do you want, what we got
Tag along, crank it up
Sing a song, you know it don't stop
In every single city
People singing in their cars
From mommies to daddies
Who drive cuz they're daddies
In every single bus, baby
To and from school
Everybody feels a rush
And it's time to act cool
When the beat rocks
It's high like so
Repeat after me didiyum didio
When the show starts
It's high like so
Repeat after me, sing it loud
Everybody go... didyum didio
Everybody like this ya'll
Everybody like that ya'll
Everyone come and follow me
Everybody like this y'all
Everybody like that y'all
Everybody come and follow me[Repeat chorus and fade...]


See you walking down the street
Every single day
Girl you never seem to have a smile on your face
What you need is someone who would treat you right
From the morn' til the noon, the noon til the night
Ain't no doubt about what I would do
I'd make a long list
I think you'd approve
You gotta think big
If you wanna succeed
I've got plans girl
It's you and me
Yo, ever since we met
Way back in the day
I'm thinking how to put it
Girl, what can I say
To make you understand how far I'd go
For your heart girl, I just want you to know
That I'd do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would
Like Evil Kenevil
Jumps a cannon like an eagle I'll be your super hero
Protect you from evil
Like batman, spiderman, superman
I can be a man
Be my Jane, I'll be Tarzan
Romeo for Juliet
She'll never have another
Scully and Mulder
They were made for each other
Babe Ruth and his bat
Tiger Woods and Nike hat
Can't you see, girl
That we go together like that
One thing I'd like to mention
I'd give ya every second
Of my full attention
I'd give all of this
Ya know that I could
So gimme one chance
To say - I would
I'll do anything in this world for you
I'll push it to the limit
To the max, to the ends of the Earth
Ain't nothing I won't do
Make every single wish come true
I'll take it to the edge of the universe
Givin' all I could
You know that I would
Ya see, I wanna create

There's somethin' that
I've got to say
You're always with me
Even though, you're far away
Talkin to you on my cell
Just the sound of your voice
Makes my heart melt
Oh girl, well it's true
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have
To question my love
And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are going out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you
I know you worry sometimes,
Some other girl will make me forget you're mine
There's not a doubt in this world
That anyone could take the
Place of my number one girl
It's true
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have
To question my love
And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are going out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you
When i close my eyes i can see you
It's like your right here
And this feeling's only gettin' stronger
You're with me everywhere
I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have 
To question my love
And every night
There's a new crowd
But it's always you
That I'm singing about
There is only one these words
Are goin' out to
Oh girl, I'm all about you

Can you tell me why things gotta be this way 
I'd rather be at the pool catchin' sunrays 
Guys in the deep end 
Girls in the shallow 
Kids in the middle shout "MARCO POLO!" 
When a get a little older Imma change things 
Makin' life go easy like ice cream 
Become president and play on the dream team 
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies 
But I guess right now Imma sit back 
While I watch Scooby-Doo eat a Scooby snack 
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack 
And do a little homework for my math class 
So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you 
Ha ha, ha ha 
Woah

Lacing the beats 
Here to the streets 
Bringing the heat 
Copping the chicks 
Dropping yo mix 
Never forget what, what, what being a kid is 
Even though I got a lot of dough 
I keep it real 
I still play my Sega Dreamcast 
When I chill 
Nickelodeon on while I'm eatin' meals 
And I bought the big screen with the Zomba Deal 
Listen up, to you kids all across the land 
I still rock my Timberlands every time I can
Never miss an episode of the Batman 
Still watching re-runs of the X-Man 
And I still show love to my parents 
Do chores when I'm home from running errands 
Come to the crib, eat a ham sandwich 
And when I'm around ya, you know what
I'm wearing, Timberlands 
So have fun - that's my point of view 
I always kick it just the way I want to 
When I roll with the changes 
I keep it real with a smile on my face, yeah 
To yourself make a promise 
Live everyday like you're gonna get your first kiss 
And if you do, you'll never lose 
The kid in you, the kid in you

Never wanna change when the get a certain age 
Not me AC, gonna be this way 
Stay this way, always say yo, yo

Okay, this is how it went down
Sunday afternoon with the fellas at the play-ground
Chillin', my father honked his horn at me
Said I have a show in Texas
And I gotta leave
Texas, wow I've never been
Maybe I can find a new hang out friend
Anyway, packin' up my bags on my way
Signin' autographs as I run to catch the plane
I seen her, chubby cheeks with long braids
Cute face, same age
She played hard to get, as I offered out my name
She just walked away with a smile
Oh my little cowgirl

She's been on my mind so much I can't stand it
My manger kept rushin' me to go
I tried to look for her. I'd give a ticket to the show
I thought I see a cowboy hat. But everyone was ready
And our luggage was packed
Hesitant for leavin' my heavensent cowgirl
We ran off to the hotel
As I practisin' in the hotel lobby
She was on my mind full time
The fellas tryin' to cheer me up
I came down with a case of Puppy Love
I went back to havin' fun
Dancin' makes ya thirsty
Plus it was time for lunch at the hotel restraunt
Order me some burgers and fries
Then to my surprise, walked in my cowgirl
Yippie-ki-yo-yippie-yay

I met myself a cowgirl
Put me on
Break it down little lady
Break it down little lady
Break it down
I met myself a cowgirl
Put me on
And now I'm on the stage
Performing infront of a capacity
Screamin' guys and screamin' girls
But still no sign of my cowgirl
As I head to the other front part of the stage
There she stood, with a smile on her face
My cowgirl, took her by the hand
Brought her onstage and I started to dance
With my cowgirl
Yippie-ki-yo-yippie-yay

Do your hands shake, baby

Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down

Trouble with the bass vibration
Race the impact
Of my new track
Take cover cause

Tracks are wickie wickie whack

From the east, to the west
To the north, to the south

Nana nanana Nana nanana
Nana nanana
Let me break it down
I remember sunny days
Chillin' on the beach
And catchin' rays
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere
Listenin' to CDs after dark
Outkast blastin Rosa Parks
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do
Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you when it's like that
To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls that held it down with me
To all the girls that gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me
Nana nanana
Nana nanana

Grab your stuff and lets all go outside 
Bang your head to this tune in your ride 
Leaving all you cares right behind 
For the summertime 
Everybody's hyped to feel the vibe 
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice 
Lay back and unwind 'cause 
Nothing else matters 
For the summertime 
I've been working real hard 
For just one reason 
I've been waiting all year 
For just one season 
The season that reminds me of palm trees 
The smell, the ocean breeze 
And the sense of being free 
Barbecues and pool parties 
What I call fun 
Hanging with the honey's 
And enjoying the sun 
Spendin' 4 hours just to clean the Benz 
So you can cruise down the 
boulevard with your friends 
Sights on the beach have got your mind blowing 
Drinks on the chill 
The money is flowing 
Right here is where you belong

For the summertime 
Had to take a sip of Ma's Homemade 
Freshly squeezed lemonade 
Check out the honeys in my brand new shades 
As they lay on the sand 
Topping up on the tans 
Take in the scenery 
The mood is fine 
Nobody's wearing their watches 
Nobody's checking the time 
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mine 
That's the summer the summer

Those simple days
Just you and me, mmmm
I think baby I know
What's on your mind
Cuz you look like you've
Got something to say
I may not say those words anymore
But maybe it just ain't my way
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you
Remember we used to laugh and say
No one understood our way
And there were times
When you would cry
And came knocking
On my door
And I was there
To shelter your pain
I think baby you should
Get that off your mind
Make it seem like
A brighter day
I may not say those words anymore
But maybe I can make it my way
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you
The answer girl
Lies within your heart
Take a look inside
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you
In you, in you

Gonna take you on a ride
Gonna get it along
Gonna get it along fine
I got the skills
If you got the style
You do it for me
It's the way you smile, girl
Take people home
To a hip hop beat
Knock me down
Knock me off my feet
Whip one up
Let's get on the with the show
Oh yeah, the way to go
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
It's too good to be true
Now I'm riding with you
Too bad to believe it
If you know what I mean
Got me spinning around
With my feet off the ground
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true
Nanana nananana
Nanana na nananana
Nanana nananana
Nanana na nananana
And I don't wanna come back down
It's too good to be true


Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Six thirty mama get you out of bed
e-mail what you gonna wear to you girlfriend
Skip you Breakfast, forget your backpack
When your half way, and you runback
Your daddy's angel with a halo
Everybody's looking at you more like a J. Lo
There is so much more to you
So put me to the test
I don't have to guess
What you wanna know now baby
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
Now your middle name is August
But I remember you were born in November
You lived in Jersey but you from Ontario
Your twin sister likes to talk in stereo
We got so much in common
Like Jane & Reeds with lots of Bottom
But there's more we could do
So put me to the test
I don't even have to sweat
What you wanna know now baby
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
I want you to know
Baby I've been studying
Pulling all nighters
When I could've been partying
I can't fail
It's in the details
Understanding all that which is female
Some guys don't ever see what they're missing
Talking about themselves when they should be listening
I pay attention to things you say to me
When it comes to you
It's in my memory
When it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it when it when it comes to you
I know everything and anything
What you like to do
What you like to wear
What you what your putting in your hair
I know you smile when you get mad
I know the Green Mile makes you sad
I'll stop for now
But I ain't through though
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
When it goes to you

Ain't no distance we'll take it like that
The grassy ain't green ah ah

From the valleys to the hill to the town
All the friends and fam mama you know
Everybody come together make a half black
White Spanish Chinese
Show me what you got
Troubled times bring
About troubled vibes
I chill you out, baby
Lemme clear your mind
From New York to Cali
Everywhere in between
Ain't nobody gonna stop our dream

I've been around on this journey
And I'm learning
As the world keeps turning
You got a face to fight
Just to live the dream
Who could've believe
That one of achieved
Who would have ever guessed
It would be like that
(Come on)
But through it all
Who's been there for me
To care for me
Even shed a tear for me
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)
It's a dream that
I've come so far
The ups and downs were there
But I've worked so hard
Many people don't know the life I live
Always on the road, always planning the show
Getting down to business in the studio
I can face the day cause the love you give
Through it all when the day is done
The nights begun
You're still my No. 1
You're the one who's kept it real
So in return this is how I feel
(Come on)
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)
One shout to my family
Cause when things get hard you understand me
Two shouts to my boys at home
Although I'm not there you know you're not alone
Three shouts to my label
Cause with them I would not be able to make the fourth
Shout out the ones I think about
Masterpiece to the masterplan
That's you the fans
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me, come on)
Do you mind where I came from?
And I had to tell you in this song
Without you
Where would I be?
(Come on, hit me out now)
No matter where the
Road may lead me..
Hometown boy
Or a face on TV
It's plain to see
That without you
There'd be no me
(Be no me)


When I look into your sad eyes
It makes me feel for you

You're gonna make it through
I wanna see you

AC, AC
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Shoulda known something was up 
When I got up 
Something felt funny to me 
From the get up
Jumped up out of the bed
With my head up
Guess who was staring at me? 
An ET or an alien 
But he said his name was Steve 
And he didn't look like what I thought he would be 
He said "Aaron, will you help me please 
Get your space suit and come with me"
So we hoped up, in the space truck 
It was all combed out with the system up
And I thought we were going to Mars 
We made a left 
At the dipper
Never figured that we'd be here with a space majiggy
We got there and I read a sign 
It said "Welcome AC, it's about time 
Can you show us, 
Can you help us, 
To dance tonight? 
'Cause we have no rhythm 
And we’re running outta time"
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation
Listen up 
Here’s what you got to do 
You take one step up 
Don't try to take two 
Make sure that you bump your fists like this
Nod like this, and rock like this
Cuz everybody gotta learn this way
To a be together, stay together
Know we gonna inovate
Moonwalk, star drop
A universal big top
Circus notice, and you gotta know this 
It really doesn't matter
If you're short or tall
Green or blue 
Fat or bald 
'Cause I came with a groove 
And I'm proving it all 
Around these parts we don't take no show 
With the unity soon to be in the streets
You can see with your own eyes
How far we've come
'Cause we didn't have rhythm, now we've got some
It's just another day in the AC Nation
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation
You say you wanna dance 
Well, here’s your chance 
(Uh, uh) 4-3-2-1 
Break it down, we gonna break it on down 
(Uh, uh)
Right, right to left 
(Uh, uh)
Right, right to left 
Up and down and side to side
C’mon, what, we're gonna bounce like this 
What, what. We gonna pump them fists, what 
AC baby, AC baby, that's where we at C’mon, drop it down 
4-3-2-1
Drop it down
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat dont stop in AC's Alien Nation
Roll up to the rock where 
There's a universe of rhythm
And the beat don't stop in AC's Alien Nation
Everyone is a cosmic freak
And we only have one mission
Gotta move as one in AC's Alien Nation[Repeat chrorus and fade...]

I turn off the radio
All the windows down
Still seems like your right here beside me
Down every back street
There’s a memory
Can’t believe the way, I still see your face in everything
It won’t stop, no matter where I’m runnin’
You don’t stop, your love just keeps on hauntin’ me
I can’t stop, forgetting that it’s over
But still I’m never alone
Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (city lights)
Look for the sunrise, live for the daylight
That’s the only time I find that you’re not right on my mind
Don’t let the sun go down cause that’s when it happens
It’s getting closer, I feel it comin’ tonight
It won’t stop, no matter where I’m runnin’
You don’t stop, your love just keeps on hauntin’ me
I can’t stop, forgettin’ that it’s over
But still I’m never alone
Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
The city lights (Ohhh, city lights)
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovin’ the night
Under the city lights, there’s nowhere to get away
It’s like nothing is safe for me
You keep on chasin’ me 
Under the city lights, the memories come alive
Burning me deep, inside tonight 
(Let me go, set me free) 
The city lights
(Ohhh, city lights)
(let me go, set me free)
The city lights
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, every night
The night time
Every night was our time
Only live a lifetime, lovin’ the night

Bad luck and trouble
Get out of my way
My lady fortune's
Coming to stay
Don't need no bullshit
No mister Big
Don't need no contract
No papers to rig
I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's
Coming back again
I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more
Bad luck and trouble
Get out of my face
You're just a loser
Get off of my case
Can't stand the thunder
Can't keep me down
You're going nowhere
Stop messing around
I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's
Coming back again
I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more
Bad luck and trouble
Are passing me by
Your days are numbered
It's your turn to cry
No time for losers
With nothing to say
Sunshine and blue skies
Are heading my way
I ain't gonna take it
Take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can't be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more


Way behind the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground
My reign will be a super-awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
I'm going to be a noble king
So enemies beware
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Nobody saying do this
Nobody saying be there
Nobody saying stop that
Nobody saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way
I wanna be king
(HOLD)
Nobody saying do this
Nobody saying be there
Nobody saying stop that
Nobody saying see here
Free to run around all day, yeah
I’ll be free to do it my way
The time has come
As someone said
To talk of many things
This may be true
But I would rather stick to talking kings
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine
The monarchy is waiting to go zing, yeah
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh... Oh... Oh I just can't wait to be king
Oh, yeah... oh oh oh
King of the world, yeah
Oh (Oh)... Oh (Oh)... Oh I just can't wait to be king
I wanna be king
Come on


[Verse 1]
I got a friend and I may just get him
Ready and a push with a mic in my right hand
Move you, groove you
Get something to dance to, if you want to
Step outside, come along, let's ride
Don't listen to the talk, take a walk on the wild side
Thinkin', talkin', clockin', everybody's shockin', and rockin[Bridge]
Cause you know and I know
that we rule the dance floor
If the DJ's too slow-slow
I guess that it's a no-no, no-no
If I say...[Chorus]
Jump jump to say how high
Jump jump to the left to the right
Jump jump and turn around
Jump jump and touch the ground[x2][Verse 2]
Ain't gonna mix with the latest craze
Everybody's thinking it's just a phase
But they don't about going out, showing out, and hanging out
And don't know the rules about...[Bridge][Chorus][Rap:]
Say boomity boom boom, boombastick
Fun fun fun, funtastick
Swing the nation
Cause a sensation
Or good vibration
??
Somebody, anybody, everybody
SCREAM!
Yo, Aaron, where you at, man?[Chorus x2, fade out]


It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
And ya know we're gonna groove
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
Leave it up, leave it up to me
Listen to the kids
Grown up, sewn up
Even when they mess up
Actin' like it's all sewn up
Mom and dad think we
Need to have a talk
Think the kids rule the world
Boys and girls
You can't blame us for notta
You taught us, to follow orders
Cuz I'm the baby, dun gotta
Monkey see (ah ah)
Monkey do no more
The fun stops here
What's the score
We might start a play fight
Just to imitate you
Donchya feel silly now
Shame on you
Don't start to cry now
I don't blame you
Afterall your just a grown-up
Whachya gonna do
It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up

Gonna hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me
When the grown-ups go awol
Who ya gonna call
Here come the young ones
The baby crime busters
Big people, listen up
Relax now we're equal
And if the money's right
Then we might make a sequal
Do I hear a "please"?
I love it when you beg me
I need a bribe now
Just to move my legs, see
And I might fit you in
If you make way

Mom and dad, they be
Gettin' on my nerves
Workin' em, workin' em
Is that what I deserve
But after many days
Hey, I want them back
Tell me who's gonna bake
My cake and all that
Who's gonna suffer from
My practical jokes
And answer when I'm moving
Hey, it's gotta be my folks
And who's gonna get me up
Ready for the flight
And who's gonna tell me
"Everything's alright"
But wait a minute
That sounds so soft
That won't impress a
Hot chicka that I cross
Don't play me out cuz
I'll switch ya off
You've been told old for too long
Singin' the same song
If you're old enough to vote
Then it's time to sit down
It's all about the little hommies
Takin' the crown
So if you're too young to vote
Here's your chance to have a say
Come on everybody
Help me save the day
It's the kids. Even I
Gotta heat it up, heat it up
What's the deal. Doncha know I
Gotta give it up, give it up
Make way, put it on
Gotta hook it up, hook it up
How's that
Leave it up, leave it up to me
It's the kids

I used to love a girl
Sometimes I still think I do
Thinking about her makes me a little crazy (crazy)
She used to be my world
How could we be split in two
We were just like peas in a pod (a pod, a pod)
I'm offically losing my mind
Chasing behide her heart (her heart)
This just can't be real
So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go
I tried to play the field
Lost my share in one a few
I never really hit one out the park
No, I guess I wasn't healed
Trying to forget the truth
Life without you left me with a scar
I'm offically losing my mind
Chasing behide her heart (her heart)
This just can't be real
So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go
So I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go go
So long ago, go, go, go
It hurts to move on
But I gotta let go, go, go
Cause she let go, go, go
From my mind, my body, my soul
I gotta let her go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
I gotta let her go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

Just a song where is feeling show [The Moffats]
And if someone feels the same about the simple song [Gil]

And maybe you can hear them sing [Nick-BSB]
Music gives you Happiness and Sadness [`N Sync]
But it also [Blumchen] it also heals your soul [Chorus][Brian-BSB]
Let the music heal your soul
let the music take control

Hey girl
Keep your head high
I never said I
Wouldn't be back when I'm
Leavin' on the red eye
Gotta do this show so I can get my dough
Lookin' up at the house on top of the hill
Where we can drop and get ill
A little spot we can chill
Or hide out whenever things get real
Shorty, wontcha tell me how ya feel
If I will
How can I be sure
If your love remains here
Well, I gotta go
Until we get this clear
Ya just gotta know
When you're not there I be so tight
No matter what I try, it won't go right
My shorty
Cause you got my back
My shorty
You keep it real like that
My shorty

Shorty ain't around...
I don't feel right
My shorty
My baby
My lady
Come with me
On tour 2 months 8 weeks 60 days later
I threw so many groupies off
One I even made her cry
Had to tell her I really didn't hate her right
Couldn't wait awhile
'cause we had to say goodbye
I never thought that I
Would never see that day that I
Fall for her the way that I did
So I will say that I
Never stray cause I find a better way when
I hold it down and keep it tight
Could never say goodbye
My shorty
'cause you got my back
My shorty
We keep it real like that
My shorty
I wanna be where ya at
My shorty
That's why I'm FELLIN' like that

I come from a bottom of hate but I made it
I’ve been dead broke and I’ve been famous, yeah
I’m not afraid to get dirty
I’ve seen concrete grown roses
But you know it’s not an easy life
Yeah we all get a second try
And it don’t matter what you have
Or the cars you drive
It’s gonna be a crazy ride
You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud there’s a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know
Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together
Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life
Yeah my 99 problems ain’t gon’ stop me
I got air to breathe and my heartbeat and you can
Try to hold me down
I know exactly who I’m gonna be[?] where life can [?]
But that don’t mean that no one loves ya
You know you gotta keep your head up
Yeah you gotta keep your head up
You know the storm can last long
But after every cloud there’s a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get you back on track you know
Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together
Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life
Let’s be blind to all the colours
‘cause we’re all sisters and brothers
We are, we’re all superstars
Together
Oh oh
Through all the hate and love we bounce back again
Oh oh
It’s alright
Yeah that’s life


She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (she's coming out of thin air) 
She blew in like the wind 
Became more than just a friend 
And now I just can't wait to see her face again 
That girl so beautiful, got a body I can't forget 
She got style, she got class 
And her smile's like the sunset 
I can see the lighting , I can hear the thunder 
I can feel her heartbeat, but I can't find her 
I can feel the rain all over my face 
Like a hurricane, she's taking me away.... 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
Came out of nowhere 
I was not prepared 
Almost time to evacuate, I feel it getting near 
The sky is getting dark, and now I'm getting scared 
She got style, she got class 
The girl is a perfect storm... 
I can see the lighting, I can hear the thunder 
I can feel her heartbeat, but I can't find her 
I can feel the rain all over my face 
Like a hurricane, she's taking me away... 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's just like a storm 
She's running on the waves, washing up on the shore 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air) 
She's coming out of thin air (thin air)


[Kayla:] Give me a world that's equal on all sides[Aaron:] Let freedom flow as constant as the tides[Kayla:] I pray with each sunset, don't forget to rise[Aaron:] (Don't forget to rise)[Kayla:] I live without regret[Both:] For ordinary lives[Both:] I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes[Aaron:] I see a land with liberty for all[Kayla:] Yet still I know the truth will rise and fall[Aaron:] (Oooh yeah-yeh)
That's just the way it goes[Both:] A word now to the wise
The world was made to change
Each day is a surprise[Both:] Lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
Looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes[Both:] And I know when you're looking for the truth
(Mmmhmm)
If you go and read between the lines
You'll discover how and why[Aaron (rap):] I take my heart into battle
Give that freedom bell a rattle
Get my independence signed
Declare it on the dotted line
In Philidelphia freedom ring
And patriotic voices sing
Red White & Blue never give up
We represent America[Both:] I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes


It's been to long
I've been waiting to see you
Endless nigths I lie awake thinging what went wrong
I'm afraid that it's too late but I'm still hanging on
Where have you gone, mother
It's been so long since I've seen you
Can someone take me home
I can't take this anymore, mama
Are you thinking of me
Do your days feel empty
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh
Is it worth a life time of bitter seperation
How can we forgive when all we want is...
Vindicationnn
I shut you out of my life
Erased you from my mind
Hey
Changed my number
Went to hide
But I still feel you inside
Where have you gone, mother
Do you know how much I love you
Can someone take me home
Can you take me home
Where I belong
Are you thinking of me?
Do your days feel empty?
Do you look at the photographs, the ones that use to make us laugh?
Is it worth a life time of pain and separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Are you thinking of me?
And do your days feel empty?
Do you look at the photographs
The ones that use to make us laugh?
Is it worth a life time of bitter separation
How can we forgive when all we want is vindication
Ohhhh woah oooh
Is it worth a life time?
Ohhhhhhhh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh


Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home to what I know
Where things move a little slower
And people always wave goodbye and say hello
And the maples on this road they must be three hundred years old
Just imagine all the stories they could tell
Of the tractors and the cars
All comin' home from Liston's bar
And the country folk just out to raise some hell
To raise some hell
This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
So I just hit the ground and keep on runnin'
All of yesterday has come and gone
And so you try to pick up all the pieces
Put it all back the way that it belongs
Well the next thing that you know
It's time to play another show
I'm leavin' out of here just after dawn
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back when you are gone
When you are gone
And this is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
And my amendment rights
They keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
This is my home
This is where I belong
Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong
Where my amendment rights
Keep me safe at night
Where my neighbors are my friends
And the story never ends
And the story never ends
Another two months on the road
Just two more miles I'll be home
To what I know


If I could walk on water, like Jesus did before,
If I knew all the answers, to keep you coming back for more,
If I could paint a picture, and then cut off my own ear,
If I chose all the right colors, would this just disappear?
Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,
If I could write a poem, and find the perfect words,
And then put them all to music, just so my voice gets heard,
Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,
So if I could walk on water, like Jesus did before,
And if I knew all the answers, I'd keep you coming back for more,
Because, we run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
And yet we still remain,
We run in vicious circles,
Until we're, dizzy with disdain,
And there's, miles and miles between us,
Yet we still remain,
Yet we still remain


Well I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for 1500 bucks back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker back in the day he put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man and the whiskey is known to change a man
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but I smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of 1200 off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
Now it's been 12 years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.
He said "sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play"
He set up shop on sunset, he put me up at the marquee
He said "you wanna sell a million records boy you better listen to me"
He said "change your style, whiten your smile, you could lose a couple of pounds
And if you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?"
I said, no that's not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts
And a couple extra pounds never really hurt
Cause a country boy is all I'll ever be
Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my 9 or 45
I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck
And my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks
And as a country boy you know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The red, the white, the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made
"Don't tread on me" is what it says and I'll take that to my grave
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before but I'll say it again
Cause my family has always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family
I love the way it is now, and anybody that tries to change it
Has to come through me, that should be all our attitudes
'cause this is America and a country boy is good enough for me son


You're my world
The shelter from the rain
You're the pills
Then take away my pain
You're the light
That helps me find my way
You're the words
When I have nothing to say
In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
Still tangled up in you
I'm Still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you
You're the fire
That warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold
as I grow old.
You're the shore
When I am lost at sea
You're the only thing
That I like about me.
In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
I'm still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
How long has it been
Since this storyline began
And I hope it never ends
And goes like this forever
In this world
Where nothing else is true
Here I am
Still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you


Sing here on the stairs and listen to
The nighttime as the daylight fades away
It's such a haunting and familiar tune
When I hear it in the distance I can say
That I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me...
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I'm home
The north shore is where my father lives
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride
But the Berkshires are where my heart is
And when I see them in the distance I could cry
Because I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me...
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Nyla started pre-school and Indy just turned two
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
They keep getting older, time keeps going by
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry
So I just pass the sign that welcomes me to Worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that hasn't really changed with time
The way this country that I love, it used to be
Because I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I'm home...
In Massachusetts
Where my hero teaches classes everyday
When my friends, they don't treat me different
It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay
Because I'm home


I'm starting to hate all these cigarettes
And this lonely town
And I'm starting to fade like the lines on route 143
Sometimes I feel like I might wont get off this ride
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75
And this highway ain't no place home for lovers and drifters like me
All the hotels and bars
Rides in stretch cars ain't for me
I'm tired of missing the moments I'll never get back
And I'm tired of missing the smiles on my little girl's face
Sometimes i feel like i might wont get off this ride
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75
And this highway ain't no place home for lovers and drifters like me
All the hotels and bars
Rides in stretch cars ain't for me
Sometimes I feel like I might
Wont get off this ride
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75
As my bedroom rolls down this long highway at 75


There's a thousand miles and eighteen hours I've got a double drive down southbound 35
Got the hammer down, detroit made 525 pushing' my ass right down that line
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
I've got a full-grown creeping' up on my tail, no I won't make bail in this small town jail no not right here
I've got the bird dog on, radio cranked, gear jammin lane changin son of a bitch you betcha son
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
Just left the jail with a handful of pills and I won't quit til I hit the coup in Abiline
I'm almost there, there's just a few more miles, I'll make the drop, I'll turn and burn I'm outta here
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road
And that smell of burnin' diesel fuel just tells me that I'm back out on the road


In the mornin' on a Saturday
I got my girls and we're skippin' town
In my '67 442 got the rag top down
Aldean's on the radio
Ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes me smile just a little bit because it's not a Miley Cyrus song
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer.
Now we're at our little getaway
Zoe go and grab the fishin' poles
I can't think of any better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh striper on the grill tonight
Cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise, another story I can tell
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer.
Monday morning and it's gettin' late
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldean's on the radio and my three girls know every line
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there
Loaded up and living right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the music's right
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
These endless summer nights.


My grandmama worked on a factory floor,
Sewing leather for minimum wage,
While my granddaddy worked all the beer joints in town,
Tryin' to forget the memories he made.
Because when daddy was born in 1945,
We'd been fighting for what we believed.
Along with five other brothers, who stood by his side
They were ready they were willing to bleed.[Chorus:]
Red, white and blue
Those colors mean something
Those colors stay true.
Like my family before me,
I'll feel it too.
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
My daddy grew up, on the wrong side of poor
Rubbin' nickels together for heat.
Well, he and his sister had barely got by
With the clothes and the shoes on their feet.
So he joined the service when he was 18
Like his daddy and his uncles before.
He was ready to die for what he believed
To fight for what's worth fightin' for[Chorus:]
Red, white and blue
Those colors mean something
Those colors stay true.
Like my family before me,
I'll feel it too.
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
Well me and my sisters got kids of our own
And my brothers comin up on sixteen
And my daddy taught us all how to live off the land
And how to stand up for what we believe[Chorus:]
Red, white and blue
Those colors mean something
Those colors stay true.
Like my family before me,
I'll feel it too.
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
Like my family before me
I feel it too
The blood that's in my veins,
Runs red, white and blue.
The blood that's in my veins
Runs red white and blue


I've walked a mile in the shoes of a broken man
I've fallen down a thousand times and got up again
there's times I've talked to god like he's my only friend
There's time it seems the devil's trying to take me by the hand
In life, sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you
I'll borrow pages from the life of johnny cash
I've tried to find the answer in the whiskey glass
I've done a lot of things back in my shady past
I've sat on that metal bed living way too fast
Cause in life sometimes you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you
And these pictures running through my head as I sat there on that cold metal bed and wonder how I wound up here again
Cause in life you'll find you gotta slow it down a little bit
take time, rewind, appreciate the little things that life provides to you


Another cheap high rise Hotel room.
Another Place another Show.
Another Meaningless...
Destination with nowhere to go.
Another Time to say "I love you"
Another Time to say "good night"
Another Time to hear a dial tone
'Cause no one wants to fight.
Why should we fight?
'Cause I can see it in you're Eyes...
Is the Sparkle gone forever?
Don't say forever!
And I can feel it when we touch...
Is the fire out forever?
Don't say forever!
Another time to miss a Birthday
Another time to miss my Flight
I've missed so much, that I don't know what I have
And what I thought I might.
What I might 'cause
I can see it in you're Eyes
Is the sparkle gone forever?
Don't say forever!
And I can feel it when we touch
Is the fire out forever?
Don't say forever!
Now I'm lying beside you...
A stranger in you're Arms.
We drift apart together
And come back like a Storm...
Like a Storm...
Another Show up in Decatur
Another one in San Antone
Somewhere else in this Equator,
Takes me far away from Home
I'm coming Home 'cause
I can see it in you're eyes
The sparkle shines forever
This is forever
And I can feel it when we touch
The Fire burns forever
'Cause this is forever
I can see it in you're Eyes
The sparkle shines forever
This is forever
I can feel it when we touch
The Fire burns forever
This is forever


It sets above the mantel on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money
And it damn sure ain't for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
Granddaddy's gun
He bought it new out of the Sears and Roebuck catalog
And it shot a many shells over the back of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun.[Chorus:]
It's just an old double barrel twelve
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what means to me to no one
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder,
"A gun's like a woman son, it's all how you hold her."
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
My granddaddy's gun
He handed it to me on the day I turned thirteen
With a half shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
And granddaddy's gun[Chorus:]
It's just an old double barrel twelve
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what means to me to no one
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder,
"A gun's like a woman son, it's all how you hold her."
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
My granddaddy's gun
There's a long beard hanging on the livin' room wall
That I got with a box call and granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up stop sign on forty nine
That me and Billy Joe took out one night
With granddaddy's gun
It sets above the mantel on a couple rusty nails
It ain't worth a lot of money
But it damn sure ain't for sale


I just left out of corpus and I'm heading into Nashville for the day
I left my mark on music row, now back out on the road, more shows to play
I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've played concert halls and holes in walls and places that a show just shouldn't be
There's stadiums and late night shows on every major network on TV
And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
Well, I just left West Virginia, one more in Wabash and Then I'll come home
I can take this guitar off my back and hang up these ol boots cause I'm gone
And I've worn the tires off this bus ten times
I've carried contraband across state lines
I've followed yellow lines til I can't see
I'll never know where this road's takin' me


This road is going nowhere
And these, these shoes are worn too thin
There's always should-haves where I'm going
There's always could-haves where I've been.
And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here.
There's always footsteps from behind me
Why don't they ever read the writing on the wall
And all the time I've spent rewinding
It might mean nothing, it might mean nothing at all
And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here.
The bed next to me is empty
Just like the, the shell I'm still trying to fill
The things put in life to tempt me
They won't ever, they might break my will
And all the things that I've said
And the road up ahead don't mean nothing don't mean nothing
And the things that I've done and the man I've become disappear
I wish I was anywhere but here. Wish I was anywhere but here.


I've been hard up and torn down, the things I've been through
And the angels won't take me... away
And I've talked to St. Peter, he won't let me pass
So it looks like I'm going today.
So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Waylon and Whitley as well
And The Devil will be dealing' the cards as they lay
So let's have a party in hell
And washed up, and worn down, and down on my knees
The angels won't take me... away
The bartender only serves brown liquor in hell
And that sure sounds like heaven to me
So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Janis and Jim Beam as well
And Rick James will bring all the cocaine you want
So let's have a party in hell
So let's have a party and tell 'em we're home
There'll be no-show and Junior and Merle
And Jamey Johnson will be drinkin' from a brown paper bag
So let's have a party in hell


Last night I saw her face
It made me lose my place, it did
It made me wonder
How did I fumble into space
Can't eat a thing at all
My appetite is way to small, it is
Except for big brown bags
I really love that alcohol
No little girl,
That your kiss ain't what I'm missing
But your loving me,
Loving me, yeah
No little girl,
That your kiss is what I'm missing
And you're twisting me,
Twisting me yeah
No little girl
That your voice wakes me at night
Always pushing me away
Always trying to start a fight
Uh, break it down
The pain washes across me
The things that I thought we'd see, yeah
The pain washes across me
But now we're both strong and free, baby!
Last night we danced real close
That's when she feels the most, it is
Her pace is much to fast
How do I look inside my soul
No little girl
That your kiss ain't what I'm missing
But your loving me,
Loving me, yeah
No little girl
That your kiss is what I'm missing
And you're twisting me,
Twisting me, yeah
No little girl
That your voice wakes me at night
Always pushing me away
Always trying to start a fight

Bobby had everything he thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car and a master's degree
Still he's feeling lost, with no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
Says 'Change a kid's life with just a couple hours a week'
Normally he'd keep clicking, just surfing around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, Sara does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left, its hard to find the strength
She wipes a tear from her eye as she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cause after dinner, baths and homework, there's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids, too tired to fight
No money, no romance, no end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says 'I love you Mom'
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, I know we've got problems
We've got to figure out, baby
Yeah, I know we haven't been talking or touching much lately
But I know this love's
Got a lot of life left in it
Oh, so let me hold you close, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, let me know, we won't wait another minute
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
It can change the world, it can change your mind
It can change your tire in the middle of the night
It can change your name, it can change your heart
It can change your tune, it can change your life


Ooh yeah..
Oh yeah..
Across the miles, it's funny to me
How far away you are, but how near you seem to be
I could talk all night just to hear you breathe
Spend my life just living this dream
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
With all the loves I used to know
I kept my distance, yeah, I never let go
But in your arms, I know I'm safe
Cause I've never been held and I've never been kissed in this way
Yeah, you're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been, I've never been this
Close enough to see it's true
Close enough to trust in you
Closer now than any words can say
And when I'm in your arms
Need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been.. I've never been
Darling, I swear
I've never been.. I've never been this close


I'm tired of living in this bubble
So today I'm changing everything
Well, my dream's been buried in the rubble
It's time to set it free
No more keeping quiet this life inside of me
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Starting right now, I'm gonna start living out loud
Oh, yeah
Well, I'm not breaking any new ground
And I didn't reinvent the wheel
I'm just a man who finally figured out
What he really needs
So I'm turning up the volume of this song inside of me
Gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
All my demons, I have fought 'em
Inhibitions, I have lost 'em
It wasn't easy, but I taught 'em
To just get out of my way
And now, every breath I'm breathing,
The air is so much sweeter
Now that my heart has finally found a way
To start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here and now
I'm gonna start living out loud
Living out loud
Living out loud


She said, I dont even know you anymore
Were barely friends, we used to be lovers
I remember when I was all that you were living for
Now, were just living in this house like strangers
I tried to give to you everything I thought you ever wanted
To make this house a home
You still lay next to me, but all I feel is alone
How can I make you see
That a kiss is worth a thousand words
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses
Cant change the way I miss being reassured
When youd hold me close, look into my eyes and press your lips to mine
If you really wanna tell me that you love me
Want your feelings to be heard
A kiss is worth a thousand words
He just sat there on the couch looking surprised
He couldnt believe what he was hearing
It was like shed opened up his heart and reached inside
And told him everything that he was feeling
He said, I tried to give to you everything I thought you ever wanted
Been working day and night
I felt this distance too, but I never knew just what to say
To make it right
Till you said a kiss is worth a thousand words
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses
Cant change the way I miss being reassured
When youd hold me close, look into my eyes and press your lips to mine
If you really wanna tell me that you love me
Want your feelings to be heard
A kiss is worth a thousand words
In the middle of the night, they finally got it right
When they both closed their eyes and talked for hours
He told her that he loved her, that he couldnt live without her
But not a single heart was broken, not a single word was spoken
Ooh...yeah, just one kiss
One single kiss
Whoa, a kiss is worth a thousand words
A thousand love songs and a thousand roses
Cant change the way I miss being reassured
When youd hold me close, look into my eyes and press your lips to mind
If you really wanna tell me that you love me
Want your feelings to be heard
Yeah, if you really wanna tell someone you love em
Want your feelings to be heard
A kiss is worth a thousand words


It's Friday night, county road
Seventeen, off we go
It's summertime, not a care in the world
Well I remember
My two best friends and me
Takin' a trip to feel the ocean breeze
Nothing but dreams as far as we could see
Oh I remember
When fillin' that tank would seem like such a big deal
And how the wind in my hair with the sun coming up made me feel
Oh well I ain't complaining (I ain't complaining)
About the way things are (About the way things are)
Not so long ago life was oh so easy now
(Now when that innocence seems so far) When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
Jenny Thompson, our first date
I showed up early, she made me wait
Clumsy conversation with her dad
Well I remember
That bright red dress, the perfect fit
A romantic movie that I let her pick
We were both in the dark dreaming of love
Oh I remember
How her head on my shoulder seemed like such a big deal
And how the touch of her hand and that very first kiss made me feel, yeah
Well I ain't complaining (I ain't complaining)
About the way things are (About the way things are)
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
(Now when that innocence seems so far) When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
Well I've got a thousand reasons to smile these days
I've got a thousand great memories that I can't replace
But when there's weight on my shoulders and tears on my face
Even years from now I know I'll say
I ain't complaining
About the way things are
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
Now when that innocence seems so far
When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new
I ain't complaining
About the way things are
Not too long ago life was oh so easy now
Now when that innocence seems so far
When it seems so far
What I wouldn't do to make the old days new


first time i saw you girl you lit up the room
but how was i supposed to know
beyond the way that your smile caught my eye
you had something deeper to show
but the power of this emotion has revealed
love is more than what i see, it's what i feel
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
i'd seen so many amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
it's in the way you can make me laugh
and in how you believe in me
how you follow your heart no matter what the path
and how you give so unselfishly
oh, now i'm seeing colours, where there once was only grey
now i know the kind of love that takes my breath away
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
i'd seen so many amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
yeah...
well, the most amazing thing by far
is you don't even know how beautiful you are
from the ocean to the clearest starlit sky
well, i'd seen so many things, amazing things, still i was so blind
with your touch you opened up a world that i would have missed
you showed me what beautiful is
darlin' you are, what beautiful is
what beautiful is


it's been over ten thousand minutes since you said goodbye
and i've thought about that moment at least a million times
you were standing at the kitchen counter, with a single tear in your eye
the day you changed my life
well, i'm still going through the motions
well, i'm still taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
well, i can't smell the roses and the rainbows are just shades of grey
and all those things that made me happy just don't move me the same
i can't help but remember us laughing, the way i held you every night
you made my whole world come alive
well, i'm still going through the motions
well, i'm still taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
well, i was minding my own business, down at our favourite bookstore
contemplating my own existence, when you walked through that door
you asked how i was doing, so i did my best to lie
but i wanted so bad to tell you, what i really felt inside
(i'm going through the motions)
well, i'm just taking in the air
oh, my heart's still beating, i'm still dreaming
just like when you were here
but something's wrong, something's missing
and it doesn't seem fair
i'm doing all that i can do to make it through
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you
well, i'm still breathing
but this ain't living without you


where am i, what was that
that made my heart beat so fast
i'm somewhere now that i've never been
so far from the world i was living in
baby, i'm lost, but i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
i've come so far, i can't turn back
there was no star, there was no map
well, i followed you to this place
now it's too late, standing here face to face
baby, i'm lost, but i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
it just seems so right to be holding you tight
i never thought it could feel so good to be lost
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
well, i'm not afraid
i know you're the one to show me the way
lost in your arms, lost in your love
girl, since i found you, when i'm around you, i'm lost
baby, i'm lost


Well, I don't claim to know everything
But some things aren't hard to figure out
I can tell your love for me has been fading
And I know what you want to talk about
Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
I felt it skip a beat on the night we met
Moving cautiously at first, then letting go
Yeah, with each passing day, I turn another page
So there ain't much I don't already know
Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
Well, I knew this day was coming
It was there between the lines
Still I was hoping maybe I could change your mind
But that's not gonna happen
No way upon this earth
So just kiss me on last time, but don't say a word
Cause I can read your heart
It wants to say goodbye
I can read your heart like an open book
It's written in your arms
They no longer hold me tight
And what you're about to say is tearing me apart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
So don't start, baby, I can read your heart
I can read your heart


Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Bobby had everything he thought he'd ever need
A fancy new car and a master's degree
Still he's feeling lost, with no purpose in life
And nothing seems to fill the empty space inside
He sees an ad on late night TV
Says 'Change a kid's life with just a couple hours a week'
Normally he'd keep clicking, just surfing around
But something makes him stop and write that number down
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, Sara does her best just to keep the faith
But ever since he left, its hard to find the strength
She wipes a tear from her eye as she puts the groceries on the shelf
Cause after dinner, baths and homework, there's no time for herself
Two jobs, two kids, too tired to fight
No money, no romance, no end in sight
Just when she thinks she can't go on
She sees a painting on the fridge that says 'I love you Mom'
Oh, it's amazing how love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Well, I know we've got problems
We've got to figure out, baby
Yeah, I know we haven't been talking or touching much lately
But I know this love's
Got a lot of life left in it
Oh, so let me hold you close, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, let me know, we won't wait another minute
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
Love changes everything
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na na na
It can change the world, it can change your mind
It can change your tire in the middle of the night
It can change your name, it can change your heart
It can change your tune, it can change your life


I don't need no sign, don't need no map
Baby, I know right where I'm at with you
I never thought there'd be a time
But when I felt your hand in mine, I knew
So if you're thinking this is something that
Feels so good, it could never last
Let me take that worry from your mind, and I'll tell you
I, I will be there
Like heaven, earth, and water, baby
I wanna breathe the same air
The same air that I know you're breathing, honey
Every morning, noon, and night you'll see
That I'll never be that far out of your reach
I will be there
I must admit I'm new at this
But you've got something I can't resist somehow
Like a horseshoe magnet and a paper clip
Baby, I'm drawn right to your lips right now
So if you're thinking I could walk away
Baby, I'm afraid it's a little late
I've already crossed the promise line
I, I will be there
Like heaven, earth, and water, baby
I wanna breathe the same air
The same air that I know you're breathing, honey
Every morning, noon, and night you'll see
That I'll never be that far out of your reach
I will be there
So if you're thinking this is something that
Feels so good, it could never last
Let me take that worry from your mind, and I'll tell you
I, I will be there
I, I will be there, I swear


Ooh yeah..
Oh yeah..
Across the miles, it's funny to me
How far away you are, but how near you seem to be
I could talk all night just to hear you breathe
Spend my life just living this dream
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
With all the loves I used to know
I kept my distance, yeah, I never let go
But in your arms, I know I'm safe
Cause I've never been held and I've never been kissed in this way
Yeah, you're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been, I've never been this
Close enough to see it's true
Close enough to trust in you
Closer now than any words can say
And when I'm in your arms
Need you to know
I've never been
I've never been this close
You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms
I need you to know
I've never been.. I've never been
Darling, I swear
I've never been.. I've never been this close


I'm tired of living in this bubble
So today I'm changing everything
Well, my dream's been buried in the rubble
It's time to set it free
No more keeping quiet this life inside of me
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Starting right now, I'm gonna start living out loud
Oh, yeah
Well, I'm not breaking any new ground
And I didn't reinvent the wheel
I'm just a man who finally figured out
What he really needs
So I'm turning up the volume of this song inside of me
Gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
All my demons, I have fought 'em
Inhibitions, I have lost 'em
It wasn't easy, but I taught 'em
To just get out of my way
And now, every breath I'm breathing,
The air is so much sweeter
Now that my heart has finally found a way
To start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here, right now
I'm gonna start living out loud
My soul's been dying
To scream and shout
And shatter the silence
It's a beautiful sound, when each moment counts
Right here and now
I'm gonna start living out loud
Living out loud
Living out loud


I like the sound of the ocean crashing
Waves making their way to the beach
I like the sound of the gulf breeze blowing
Holding your hand, the sand on our feet
I like the sound of raindrops dancing
As we sleep away a Sunday afternoon
And I like the sound of the alarm clock ringing
Means I'll spend another day with you
So turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
I like the sound of a fireplace crackling
Watching a movie, holding you tight
Yeah, I love it when I hear you laughing
At that joke I've told a thousand times
And I like the sound of guitars screaming
Music so loud we talk with our eyes
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
I like the sound of your heart beating
In my arms, right here, right now
When it's so quiet I can hear you breathing
That may be my favourite sound
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up a little louder
I can never ever get enough
Turn it up, turn it up
Cause whenever I'm around you
You've got me thinking that
I like the sound of that


Baby, how'd we wind up this far apart
Using words as weapons like daggers to our hearts
This standoff of indifference isn't solving anything
But baby, I've been thinking 'bout what I stand to lose
I can live without being right, so if I have to choose
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your...
Footsteps down the hallway, the strength you have within
How much you say in silence, yeah, your breath upon my skin
Don't know who I am without you
Just like the very air I breathe
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
Cause I can't live without your love
As we sit here in the quiet, there's a pounding in my head
I feel the weight of a thousand angry words between us
The bitter things we said
So I'm reaching out to you tonight
Yeah, I don't care who's wrong and baby, I don't care who's right
We've come too far to let this slip away now
I'm asking you, I'm telling you
I'm begging you
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
I can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your touch
The pride I stand to gain isn't worth the pain
Can't face another day
And I don't care who's to blame
If this is what it takes, I'll be the one to break
I'm not giving up
I can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
I need you, baby


She says don't stare at me
She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
I don't know what she's talking about
She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself
Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone
You can't hide Beautiful
You can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful
She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy
And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of nowhere blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things
A little piece of heaven god gave to this world
She might think she's just an ordinary girl
You can't hide Beautiful
You can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful


Never been the kind of guy who walks around ladders
And I open up umbrellas when I'm inside
Well, black cats that crossed my path, they never mattered
But I've never had this much at stake
Don't want to lose her by tempting fate
So I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together - knock on wood
Well, it's been two weeks and everything is coming up aces
But I've seen my luck come, and I've seen it go
And for the first time in my life, I'm not hesitating
I knew after just one dance, I wasn't leaving this up to chance
I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together - knock on wood, yeah
Well, I've got my rabbit's foot around my neck
That old wishing well's got half my paycheck
Got a bag of four-leaf clovers
Anything to be her lover
Knock on wood
Knock on wood
I'm gonna knock on wood
Salt over my shoulder
Do anything to keep her love
Cause it feels so good every time I hold her
Like I always dreamed it would
I think this could be forever
The two of us together
I think this could be forever
The two of us together
Knock on wood
Knock on wood

We sat and watched the sun come up
With a blanket wrapped around us
We spend all night out on that beach
Couldn't hold her close enough to me
That was love I won't forget
And I still remember what she said
She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go
The April air, the crescent moon
Two wild hearts with nothing to lose
That weekend was all we had
But what I'd give for two more days like that
She looked at me and said goodbye
And kissed my lips one last time
She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go
Kansas, I'll always remember
Kansas, I hear your name and I am with her
She called me Kansas
She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
But it's a place I love to go
(Kansas) She said that I reminded her of home
She called me Kansas
And I know I've never been there
Oh, no (Kansas)
She called me Kansas


Barry White, he woke me out of my sleep
"Love Unlimited" on infinite repeat
I live alone, so why's the shower running?
My mind is groggy - my memory's foggy
The smell of incense lingers in the bedroom
I can't believe it's already past noon
On my arm there's a strange new tattoo
Shirt on the fan blade - pants on the lampshade
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
Empty bottle of tequila, Jose Cuervo margaritas
Popcorn and a game of Twister
You get the picture... you get the picture
A book of matches on my dresser from the Sky Bar
Doggie bag from Dos Amigos
That valet parker still has the keys to my car
Piece by piece, it's coming back to me
I met my buddies after work
We shot some pool, a couple beers
Before I knew it, we were rocking
Met some girls, we started talking
It's not like me to get nervous, but she was perfect
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
A mariachi band was playing, she was dancing close and swaying
Fireworks when I kissed her
You get the picture
Suddenly, the shower opens in a cloud of steam
Standing there, the woman of my dreams
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture, and put a frame around it
You get the picture
You get the picture, clear as a bell
You get the picture, just hang it on your bedroom wall
You get the picture


It's way too easy to live this life
With your eyes half-closed, don't I know
I spend half my time bored out of my mind
Sleep walking
Well I wake up to this fool's parade
And I watch the leaves fall down
I see everything changing
But somehow I feel caged in
Just hangin' around
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Something to set me free
Out of the ordinary
Come and rescue me
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
It's that feelin' that's so hard to explain
When the world's so big and you're so small
An you get caught up with the wonder of it all
That's what I'm missing
I saw that look today in a young kid's face
Eating ice cream in a laundromat
And if you asked him it was Christmas again
I wanna get that back
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
A little something to believe
Out of the ordinary
A taste of something sweet
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Yeah Yeah
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
Wooohooohoo
I know it's out there
I'm waitin' on the wonderful
A little something to believe
Out of the ordinary
To come and rescue me
I could use a little love, love, love
To send me a sign
I'm tired of the typical
I'm waitin' on the wonderful


She locked her fingers
Bowed her head
She said I'm late
And I'm really scared
You can go
But I hope you stay
I'm gonna keep it
Either way
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child
Laid my head
Down on the wheel
She said I know, I know
It don't seem real
She closed her eyes
But the tears broke though
She said don't hate me
For loving you
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child
I could not reassure her
Couldn't say what I had planned
Couldn't put three words together
So I just took her hand
In my daddy's El Camino
In her driveway in the rain
Staring through the windshield
I can see my future change
And my heart hit like a hammer
And my thoughts were running wild
Any fool can make a baby
It takes a man to raise a child


I grew up under normal conditions
Mom was the radio, Dad was the television
They both were doing the best that they could
Working 50 hour weeks and knocking on wood
I did my time in the public school system
I got good grades, never got a shred of wisdom
Can't blame my teachers for anything they did
You can't teach one on one with 33 kids
Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and dying the American way
I found the one, we put some roots down
Got a 2nd mortgage on the outskirts of town
Now we barbecue every 4th of July
Send our prayers and our fireworks up into the sky
Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and loving the American way
These days we're thinking 'bout kids of our own
Gonna turn this house into a home
In no time at all they'll be singing along
Ooh Ooh I'm doing all right
I work every day to get to Saturday night
Ooh Ooh I guess I'm doing O.K.
Living and dying the American way


Hey mom I know that it's late, hope I didn't wake you
Yeah, everything is O.K., just needed to talk to you
Today I had one of those days
But I didn't call to complain
Just to say everything that I didn't for all of those years
You were a taxicab driver, a nurse and a maid
A waitress, a cook and a shoulder to lay
My head on to cry on, when nothing was going my way
You knew every answer without cracking a book
And I took for granted that I had it so good
And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say
Thank you I love you
Twenty years late
It's funny how time passing by can change your perspective
A little while out on your own can sure make you think
I don't know how you did it
No I can't find one spare minute
The days run together but I don't remember you
Ever letting us down
You were the judge and the jury when I did wrong
Been my biggest fan from my very first song
The gas in the engine that always kept me moving on
A seamstress a counselor and the one referee
That could cold stop a fight between my brother and me
And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say
Thank you I love you
Twenty years late
I'll let you go now
But I hope that you know now how I feel
Thank you for making me the man I've become
I love you and I will always be your son
Mom that's all I called to say
Twenty years late


They're not really expecting me
But I know where they hide the key, under the welcome mat
There's no better place than that
Don't know how long I've been gone
All I know is it's been too long and I'm off track
That's why I'm coming back
When I see the lights of my hometown
I feel like the world stops spinning 'round
Everything makes sense
Maybe it's the innocence
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown
The static is almost gone
From the station I grew up on
I'm getting closer now
So I turn it up real loud
Funny how a little thing like that
Can make it all come rushing back
They say it's not the same
But to me it will never change
When I see the lights of my hometown
I feel like the world stops spinning 'round
Everything makes sense
Maybe it's the innocence
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown
I know it's just a few miles down the road
I'm getting there as fast as I can go
I can always find peace of mind
In the lights of my hometown


He said let's steal a car, get outta here
I got money for gas and beer
Let's point this car down a two-lane road
Just follow where the headlights go
She said I'm tired of this town anyway
Days go by but things don't change
If I stay here I know I'll die
Without ever really being alive
Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run
She slept in the dashboard light
He stayed awake and drove all night
Ran his fingers through her hair
On their way to everywhere
Morning came and she called home
From an Idaho gas station phone
She slammed the door sat down and cried
Kissed him hard and just said drive
Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run
Love is a fast train, love is a slow rain
You can't stoop it, no you can't stop it......
Hey, there ain't nothing stronger
Than lovers on the run
Hey, you can't stop a bullet
Once it leaves the gun
Lovers on the run


That night, that dress
Baby, I must confess
I was tongue-tied, but inside
My mind got way ahead of me
I'm stuck in this confusion
Trapped in some illusion
It's all because of you
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things
Sunlight on you face
Waking up with you each day
My shirt on you
Just the thought's driving me crazy
It's like I'm in a daze
Some kind of lovesick haze
Before I go insane
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things
I'm drunk on love, I'm stoned on you
I'm wasted, your face is
Everywhere I turn
Somebody help me
I need an ice-cold glass of water
You left me out here in the desert
I'm losing it, hallucinating
Somebody save me
Pour me a strong cup of coffee
My eyes are playing tricks on me
What's happening
Girl, you got me seeing things


Baby, when you smile at me
I know that you're all I'll ever need
You're my favorite song to sing
You're my raincoat when it rains
With all my heart and soul
I want you to know
I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man
When I look into your eyes
I know that's where I wanna spend my life, the rest of my life
You're my lazy Sunday afternoon
My crazy New Year's Eve, my parachute
And I love your innocence
I wouldn't change anything about you
I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man
I wanna be the man who zips your dress, that holds your hand
That's there when you wake up in the night
I wanna be the one to kiss you 'til you come undone
That makes you laugh when you wanna cry
And puts a ring on your left hand
I wanna be that man


It was a pretty good performance
Yesterday out on the street
Maybe they should give me an Emmy or an Oscar
Cause you didn't suspect a thing
We made small talk on the sidewalk
I even laughed out loud
And I didn't blink an eye when I told you that I'm happy now
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
Truth is I've had a lot of practice
I've put on this show before
Just like the day you told me we were history
I was brilliant standing right outside your door
I convinced you and me too
It was gonna be all right
That we'd both be better off that I would get on with my life
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
It's time I came clean
It's time I told the truth
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you
Baby I'm still in love with you
Yeah
I'm a good liar
I had you believing
That I wasn't dying watching you leaving
I'm good at pretending
I stood there unflinching
Baby with my heart on fire
Baby my heart's on fire
Hey I'm a good liar
Yeah I'm a good liar


Your daddy wouldn't like it if he knew what
I was thinking right now
But the way you look this evening girl it's hard to keep
Your feet on the ground
It's raining outside
Let's start a fire
Baby I say we just stay in tonight
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
It's almost like the DJ's playing every song especially for us
And it takes me back to that summer night when you and me
Learned everything about love
I just wanna hold
Your body close girl I don't wanna ever let go
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
It's almost like the DJ's playing every song especially for us
I wanna feel your heart beat all night long
When you whisper in my ear, girl it's sweeter than
My favorite song
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around baby
ooh ooh ooh
Turn up the music loud and turn the lights real low
ooh ooh ooh
There's no one else around
Let's lay down and dance to the radio
Let's dance to the radio


If I could do it all again
I'd look more in the mirror
Instead of finding someone else to blame
If I could do it all again
I'd do a lot more praying
Less cussing 'bout the things that I can't change
I'd laugh a little louder
Sing more in the shower
Care a little less if I'm in tune
Concentrate on who I am not who I might have been
If I could do it all again
If I could do it all again
I'd take it a little slower
Make a few more memories I could keep
I'd crawl in bed beside my wife and just lay down and watch her
Soaking up her beauty while she sleeps
I'd work less hours
I'd buy her more flowers
Make more love on rainy afternoons
Overlook my little faults and not my little sins
If I could do it all again
I'd walk a little taller
Talk a little smaller
Love the way my maker meant me to
I might make less money but I'd make a better friend
If I could do it all again
If I could do it all again


Your down on your luck.
You just lost your truck.
You cant afford another beer.
Your credit cards don’t work.
Whole world thinks you’re a jerk.
You wondering how you wound up here.
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
Now your sleeping on the couch at your best friends house watching Colombo
Eating cold pizza in your underwear
Just remember I told ya so
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
So if you’re thinking about saying adios
Well, take it from the fool who knows
She’s gonna serve ya papers make ya pay through the nose and when her lawyer gets through with you you’ll have to move to Mexico.
It wouldn’t been cheaper to keep her around
It wouldn’t been better to let her keep you down
Living with a crazy wife beats living with an empty bank account
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around
It woulda been cheaper to keep her around


I used to think I was a bigshot
Thought I had it all but guess what
Can't measure life by the things you got
In the end it all ends up to nothing
I swear I missed so many birthdays
Valentines, hallowe'ens and anniversaries
Left me lonesome in the worst ways
But mister I learned something[Chorus:]
You can't buy back the moments that matter
You can't buy back the moments that matter
There's a big pot of gold at the top of the ladder
But you can't buy back the moments that matter
Gonna play some football in the backyard
Teach my nephew how to play the guitar
Call up some old friends and play some cards
Waste a few Saturday evenings
Gonna take my wife out dancing
Every now and then without her asking
Spin her around singing and laughing
There's memories we should be making[Chorus]
All this talk about the good life
Makes me realize I got a great life
Gotta keep my priorities in sight
You just get one time around[Chorus]
You can't buy back the moments that matter
You can't buy back the moments that matter
Years pass you buy and the days start to scatter
But you can't buy back the moments that matter


I was watching the news tonight
Anchorman said there was a fight
And a young man died from his wounds
They showed pictures of the battle
And I almost turned the channel
Like I always seem to do
Then it hit me like a freight train coming through
That’s somebody’s son,
Somebody’s husband,
Somebody’s everything,
Out there someone’s coming undone
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebody’s son
I walked down the hall to check
On my youngest lying in bed
And I stood there watching him dream
I tried but I couldn’t imagine how we would feel if something happened
And I didn’t have him here with me
Then I cried for that dead boy and his family
He’s somebody’s son,
Somebody’s husband,
Somebody’s everything,
Out there someone’s coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
He’s somebody’s son
Somebody’s son,
Somebody’s husband,
Somebody’s everything.
Out there someone’s coming undone.
It made me wonder if anyone really wins
When every war has to be won
With somebody's son


Let me pour you a tall one,
Come sit down next to me.
Baby you look so good,
In those faded jeans.
I've been stoned cold sober,
You've been cold as ice.
I got a good idea,
Let's get drunk and fight![CHORUS:]
Let's get drunk and fight,
Keep the neighbors up all night.
You can scream at me,
And I'll make you cry.
And when the morning comes,
We'll make some make-up love,
While we apologize.
But tonight,let's get drunk and fight!
Have another pina colada
And get good and torqued down
If you need a pinata
You can kick me around!
You can insult my mother
And I'll question your past.
It turns me on when you're pissed off
Cuz, you look hot when you're mad.[chorus x2]
Baby tonight,
Let's get drunk & fight!


Baby let your hair fall down around me
Let me feel your body close right next to me
There's something about the way you look into my eyes
That let's me know that you wear no disguise[Chorus]
When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love
Baby you broke the chains around this heart
You made this jaded man put down his guard
And I don't know all the words to say how I feel inside
Baby let me show you tonight[Chorus]
When we make love
It feels brand new
And I can't imagine my life without you
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love
Baby hold on tight, don't ever let go
I wanna feel you in my arms and my soul
Baby, baby, baby
The world stands still as we move
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
And I know that we're two of the lucky few
When we make love


When I was a kid I had it made in the shade
Couple girlfriends and a Chevrolet
Oh how I long for those days
When all I needed was a couple of bucks
Just enough to put some gas in my truck
Buy a six pack of beer and get a weird haircut[Chorus]
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I grew up so they say
Got a real job and and IRA
A mortgage on this house
I can barely pay
A blackberry and a cellphone
I spend more time at work
Then I do at home
Somebody please tell me where I went wrong[Chorus]
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
I know nothing stays the same
But I feel like I'm dancing
Way too close to the flame[Chorus]
Well I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Well I used to have it all figured out
But now I'm lost
It used to be clear to me
Now everything looks so blurry
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off
Yeah I used to have a handle on life
But it broke off


Jamie's a highschool teacher
She wakes up every morning at the crack of dawn
And puts the coffee on
Gives her lectures, grades those papers
The Work ain't done when the last one's gone
She don't do it for the paycheck
Anything at all would pay the bills
Even on days her life's a train wreck
But she still loves those kids[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you
Joe's a highway worker
I saw him today when I drove by and the sun was hot
100 degrees on that blacktop sweatin'
He's out there working just getting by
He breaks his back to keep his family fed
It's all that matters much to him
Tomorrow morning he'll roll out of bed
Do it all again[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you
There ain't no hall of fame
Probably never know your name
They're everywhere around us
They're stories all the same
So here's to the cop that works the midnight beat
Here's to the maid who cleans the hotel sheets
Here's to the farmer harvestin' the fields
Here's to the trucking haulin' 18 wheels
Here's to the workers on the assembly line
The secretary, the firemen, and the men down in the mines
Here's to everyone who does their part
I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you[Chorus]
Thank God for the everyday heroes
For all you've done and for all you do
Thank God for the everyday heroes
It's a better world because of you


I knew it would happen someday
But I never thought that it'd be tonight
Then you walked into the bar
With your new Mr.Right
With that big ol'chip on my shoulder
And Johnny Walker making me see red
I decided I'd walk right on over
And pour him a beer, on his head[Chorus]
And I know I'll regret this tomorrow
It's just another cross that I'll have to bear
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
I know it's not my proudest moment
But when he swung at my face and just missed
I decided there and then I'd introduce his chin
To my right fist
Then I tipped my hat to my ex-girlfriend
Said "Darlin' you should look nice
For a low down cheatin' dead beatin'
Cold hearted witch, ruin my life[Chorus]
And I know I'll regret this tomorrow
It's just another cross that I'll have to bear
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
Yeah I know I'll regret this tomorrow
Cause Mr. Right's finally coming up for air
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care
I know I'll regret this tomorrow
Instead of leavin' I sat back in my chair
I'm Sober enough to know better
But I'm just drunk enough not to care


Skimpy bikinis and bear skin
It's always good to see them out again
Cabin fever, grey skies
Six months of winter finally waved goodbye
Sometimes this world seems cold as ice[Chorus]
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
Where all your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Sometimes it's summertime
Grab a cooler, a 12 pack
I'll rub some lotion up and down your back
Flip flop living, stress free
Nothing to do we got no where to be
Come on baby drift away with me[Chorus]
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
Where all your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Sometimes it's summertime[Chorus]
Sometimes it's summertime
All the sun's gonna do is shine
All your worries melt away
Like snowflakes on an August day
Right now life is fine
Nothing but peace of mind
Leave all your cares behind
Sometimes it's summertime
Sometimes it's summertime


Well I've seen the sunset from the top of a mountain
And I've walked the streets of Katmandu
I've seen a sky so full of stars, I couldn't count them
But I ain't never seen nothing like you
I've felt forgiveness looking out over the ocean
I've been lonely in a cheap motel
I've felt love as gently brush against my skin
But I've never felt nothing like you[Chorus]
You, you're too beautiful for words
You, you move me so much it hurts
Never had something I was so afraid to lose
I never had nothing like you
Well I would give away all of my tomorrows
Let my soul turn black and blue
Just to spend one night lost in your arms
Cause I ain't never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you
Never had nothing like you


There's no frost on the windows,
It's always eighty degrees,
Everybody is beautiful
and there is always an ocean breeze.
They got palm trees and white sand,
Moviestars and Malibu,
Got everything that a man could want
Well everything but you.[Chorus:]
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warmer
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.
I bet back home its snowed,
You're good and warm in your bed.
I wonder if you miss me,
Cause I just can't get you out of my head.
I haven't seen you in so long,
But I still feel you so strong.
This place looks so right,
But feels so wrong.[Chorus:]
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warm
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.
Three in the morning
And I can't sleep,
And if I could you'd be in my dreams.
Laying here without you I'm not me[Chorus:]
That's the trouble with California,
The sun is out and the weathers warm
But you're not here, you're not here.
And I've been trying so hard to make it
It's paradise but my heart is breaking,
Cause you're not here.
That's the trouble with California.
That's the trouble with California.
That's the trouble with California,
You're not here.


There’s no place I’d rather be
Than on this blanket here with you
Watching that big red sunset
Into a Caribbean blue
We’re sure it’s hot down here
Or maybe it’s just you
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Let’s let the ocean waves
Gently serenade us
With a sexy island song
There’s no one around
And you keep turning me on and on and on
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Well I’m glad we stole that bottle
From a hotel tiki bar
And I’m glad the moon ain’t out tonight
So we can hide out in the dark
Let’s show off our tan lines
To that endless sea of stars
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Let’s let the ocean waves
Gently serenade us
With a sexy island song
There’s no one around
And you keep turning me on and on and on
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong[Instr.]
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
By tomorrow morning
Baby we’ll be boarding
That plane and flyin’ home
There’s no one around
God you’re turning me on and on and on
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong
Baby let’s get sand
In places sand just don’t belong


Well I don't drive through the night these days
It's just not a chance I'm willing to take
And I don't spend my money foolishly
Cause there's important things that you're gonna need
You already got a hold on me
And I haven't even heard you cry
I haven't even looked into your eyes
I haven't held you one time but you've changed my life
And I don't even know your name
But I know I'll never be the same
Oh I can't wait to show you you can fly
And I haven't even heard you cry
You might look like your mom, you might look like me
I don't really care as long as you're healthy
And I'll make mistakes there's no doubt
But loves one thing you won't live without
Cause you own a place in my heart now
And I haven't even heard you cry
I haven't even looked into your eyes
I haven't held you one time but you've changed my life
And I don't even know your name
But I know I'll never be the same
Oh I can't wait to show you you can fly
And I haven't even heard you cry
Well I don't even know your name
But I know I'll never be the same
Oh I can't wait to show you you can fly
I'm thinking about first steps and bike rides
And I haven't even heard you cry


There’s a calendar hanging in the kitchen,
Today I’m taking it down I’m tired of living
Like tomorrow can’t get here fast enough.
Took a while but I’m finally learning
To make the most of each moment I’m given
Instead of waiting on better days to come.
No more wishing my life away.
These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I won’t look ahead,
I won’t look back.
I’m gonna live,
I’m gonna laugh.
Well I won’t let another second waste,
These are those days.
It’s been awhile since I’ve called up my mother
Just for the sake of saying I love her,
Ain’t gonna wait around till it’s too late.
I’ve always wanted to see the Grand Canyon.
Its time I stopped talking and just start planning.
No more excuses no more saying someday, someday.
No more dreaming my life away.
These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I won’t look ahead,
I won’t look back.
I’m gonna live,
I’m gonna laugh.
Well I won’t let another second waste,
These are those days.
These are those days,
This is my life,
The time is now to get things right.
I won’t look ahead,
I won’t look back.
I’m gonna live,
I’m gonna laugh.
Well I won’t let another second waste,
No, I won’t let another second waste.
These are those days.
(This is my life, the time is now to get things right.)
These are those days.
(I won’t look back, I’m gonna live I’m gonna laugh.)
Don’t wanna waste my life away,
These are those days.


If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live
Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
But I... Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy


There's no need for you to worry about anything
Who can say what the future gonna bring
But if you worry about tomorrow
It will only bring you sorrow
Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine
Hold your head up high
Face the future with a smile
Things'll be better
It just takes a little while
So when your feelin' low, down and out
You're gonna shine without a doubt
Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine
Life is just what you make it
Can be good or can be bad
How can you miss something you never had
When things go wrong don't forget
There's no need for you to get upset
Go out and have a good time
For this world is so fine
Go out and have a good time
This world is so fine
This world is so fine
It's gonna be alright


(Lee diamond, george davis)
It was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
You've beat me to the girl that I always wanted
You thought you had her brother but you still don't own her because I'm not through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride
I know that it's a fact that you sneak behind my back
Smiled in my face and deceived me with your lies, but I'm not through
Oh, there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride
But this is the part that you knew nothing of
She confessed to me that she toyed with your love
You were just a game, that she loved to play
You never had her
She took you for a ride
All of her ecstasy that you had
Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
You had her brother, you were my guest
You pawned your broken heart just like all the rest
And now you are through
And there's nothing you can do
You never had her
She took you for a ride
Was just imagination, the temptation that went to your head and now you are a victim of circumstance
She took you for a ride


I play the game of the modern romeo but never in my life did I see
A woman as square as a pool table and twice as green
I gave you all of my money and all of my loving too
But now you're goin' around just a telling everybody that I made a fool of you
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
I ask the man from up above, help me to save your love
I want you
You're a hard nut to crack
You take a strong man and break his back
I don't know but I've been told, next to you my life's been cold
You're a demon, girl, you know you're outta sight
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
Ask the man from up above, help me to save your love
I want you
Know the guy you're giving my money
And you come home and call me honey
You look like you made a resolution, took my best friend john and put him in an institution
You're a demon, girl you know you're outta sight
Girl I love you so, why I love you I just don't know
I ask the man from up above to help me to save your love
I want you
You're a hard nut to crack


You think you're so smart
Yes, you think you know it all
But the game you're trying to play
Can be played another way
And you see that, you never never had it so good 'till you met me
I brought you to the city
Now you tell me, there's no room for pity
My friends tried to tell me so
I told them they didn't know
That lights have gone to your head
You never never had it so good 'till you met, until you met me, oh until you met me
No you never, you never, you never had it so good


Too many, too many mornings,
Gotta wake up soon
Too many, too many mornings,
Whoa Lord gotta wake up soon
Oh and eat my breakfast by the light of the moon
It was late, very late last summer,
When I first got my time
Whoa it was late, very very late last summer
You know when I, I first got my time
My buddy got one hundred years,
Thank the Lord I just got ninety-nine
If you see, if you see my mama,
Won't you tell her this for me
Lord, if you see, if you see my dear old mother,
Won't you please tell her this for me
I got a long long time
And Lord knows when I'm gonna be free
You know they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin'
But you know that they won't last long
Lord, they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin',
But you know that they won't last long
One day they're gonna wish they were a baby boy
In their mothers arms
You know they're always, always talking
About dangerous blue
Whoa, you know they're always talking
About dangerous blue
If I had my big old pistol,
You know I'd be dangerous too
Twelve jury men found me guilty,
The doorman looked me up and down
Lord, twelve jury men found me guilty,
You know the doorman looked me up and down
Just looked at me through the corner of his eye and said
Boy, you're penitentiary bound
One day, one day down in New Orleans,
All the girls gonna jump and shout
Lord, one day down in New Orleans
All the girls gonna jump and shout
When them big green gates open up wide,
I'll come steppin' out


You said he was just an old acquaintance that you knew a long time ago
I could tell when he held you in his arms, you seemed spellbound by his charms
No need to try, you can't deny, that look in your eyes spelled love, love, love, love
L o v e, l o v e, l o v e was all I saw, it was love, love, love, love
And I used to call you on the telephone
And I thought, I thought it very funny why you were never home
And I used to believe that I could trust you
But I find that you untrue
Lately, lately I find that I'm all by myself
Thinking you love me, when it's someone else
Hats off, hats off to you and your new lover
'Cause for me, 'cause for me there will be no other
Girl, to take your place, with tears on my face
Farewell to you, may God bless and keep you
Please dear lord keep her safe for me
Farewell, farewell my darlin', my darlin', my darlin
Whoa I need you, I need you, I need you


Since you're gone with your guy
I feel as though I want cry
But a man ant supposed to shed a tear
If only you were here (you've gone away baby), if only you were here (you've gone away baby)
If only if you were here I'd lie for you, darling I'd die for you
Please say you're coming home
Since you've gone away
Been working hard while you're at play
Never thinking that you are untrue
Didn't worry over you
So long, this is goodbye
I didn't want you to leave me, but I've got my pride
There's one thing I want you to know
Girl I love you so (you've gone away baby), girl I love you so (you've gone away baby)
You've gone away (you've gone away baby)
So long (you've gone away baby)
Oh my darling, so long


Hey la, um de hey oh la
Said, hey la, um de hey oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Said hey, oh hey, feelin' good today
One day as I was a havin' myself a party
You know a flyin' saucer landed right by my side
You know a big green man jumped out and boy you know he robbed me
You know he beat me for my bottle before I got high
I hittim' up knowing that I was dead
'Cause he had that big ray-gun pointed at my head
But curiosity will get the best of the best
You know he smelled that bottle and the liquor did the rest
And I said, hey la, um de hey oh la
Hey la, um de hey oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey, oh hey, it ain't over yet
Turned that bottle up and started drinking
It was a long, long time before he pulled it away
His eyes got crossed and man his knees started wobblin'
He took four steps forward and this is what he said
He said, hey la, um de hey, oh la
Hey la, um de hey, oh le
He said hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey oh la, feel good today
I could see this cat was a just about to party
'Cause he had that great big green in his eye
He said come on hurry on down, let's forget our troubles
Just jump in my space hot-rod and take a little ride
So now I'm not afraid of no kind of space man
'Cause I keep my defenses by my side
And if you ever see me any place or any time
You can bet I'm a holding my bottle by my side
And I'm gonna sing hey la, um de hey, oh la
Hey la, um de hey, oh le
Hey, hey, hey, hey oh la
Hey oh hey, I feel good today

For that's what love will do
Darling, I'm so surprised,
Oh, when I first realized
That you were fooling me
Darling, they say that our love won't grow
I just want to tell them that they don't know
For as long as you, long as you are loving me
Our love will grow wider, deeper than any sea
And all the things in the world, in this whole wide world
Is just that you would say that you'd be my girl

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely, they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?

You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand beneath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh, I know that the music's fine like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
And don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Baby, don't you know I love you so
Oh, can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
Oh, I love you, oh, so much
You can dance (You can dance)
Go and carry on till the night is gone, and it's time to go
(You can dance, you can dance)
If he asks (You can dance)
If you're all alone (You can dance)
Can he take you home (You can dance)
You must tell him no (You can dance)
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' (save) save the last dance for me

There'll be some flowers bringin'
Gonna be some sad singin'
Over you, I say over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through

People peepin' from their window screens
Parade of cars with their headlights on
All of that will be goin' on
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby

For you baby to take your sleep
Into a pine box an' down you'll go
Where you will stay where it's free of snow
Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through
All your folks will be dressed in black
Ride a long black cadillac

Over you, I said over you
Over you, pretty baby
If I ever hear you say we're through
Say I want to slay you baby, whoa now

Even though we're apart you're still right here in my heart 
Your hands are still in mine, I can still hear you whispering words divine 
I can feel your warm embrace, just the thought of it puts a smile upon my face 
But my imagination, whoa I said it's so strong, but reality keep assuring me I'm all alone 
But now from my lips comes a song, with tears in my eyes, 
Cuz now you're gone, so all your sweet talk........ 
Even though we're apart, you're still right here in my heart 
My imagination, Oh I said it's so strong, but reality keeps assuring me that I'm all alone 
My imagination, Oh so strong, but reality keeps assuring me that I'm all alone

(hey little Alice, hey little Alice)
I know a little girl lives down the street (hey little Alice)
She's a rockin' little mama, and she sure is sweet (hey little Alice)
She comes out early with the rising sun (hey little Alice)
She comes back in the evening when the day is done (hey little Alice)
Night time comes and she's out again (hey little Alice)
Well this time, this is where the fun begins (hey little Alice)
Down at the corner there's a local dance (hey little Alice)
Every weekend there's a local band (hey little Alice)
Featuring nothing but rock and roll (hey little Alice)
Alice wouldn't miss this to save her soul (hey little Alice)
(hey little Alice, hey little Alice)
I went to the corner and walked in the door (hey little Alice)
Alice as usual had took the floor (hey little Alice)
Like the girl with the red dress on (hey little Alice)
She could shake that thing all night long (hey little Alice)
Right behind me I heard some people say (hey little Alice)
She never quits until the band stops playing (hey little Alice)
(hey little Alice, hey little Alice)
I'm talking about Alice now, you know she's alright (hey little Alice)
I said she's alright now, I said she's my girl (hey little Alice)
I'm talking about Alice now, I'm talking about Alice now
Oh yeah now, I said come on, come on


Every time the telephone rings I hold my breath
Hoping that it's you, I'm scared to death
Phone went ring, my crippled heart cried
Let it be you, on the line
Then a voice say hello, can I speak to joe? 
Wrong number, I'm sorry, good bye
Pity the fool who loves you so
If you found someone new, don't let me know
The phone rang once again, my heart skipped a beat
Must be you, this is my belief
Then the voice on the other end say can I speak to ben? 
Wrong number, I'm sorry, good bye
I live simply on the memory
Of your love that was once for me
Come back my darling please
And set my heart at ease
Then a voice say hello, darling you know I love you so
Hold on baby, 'til I tell these blues good bye
'til I tell these blues good bye


[take 14: "jesus h. christ", 2-3-4]
There's a new girl in my neighborhood
She's a sweet little thing, she looks real good
She gets everybody's attention around
They call her sweet little mama
All the boys wink when they see her
Even the girls smile when they meet her
Everybody's trying to be first
To hold sweet little mama
She got a certain secret in her smile
That makes you wanna stay awhile
But the minute you get too close
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry
Stop by my house and you can't miss her
This little girl is my little sister
She's about 9 days old
They call her sweet little mama
Say she got a certain secret in her smile
That makes you wanna stay awhile
The minute you get too close
She bursts out with a loud, loud cry
Stop by my house, you can't miss her
This little girl is my little sister
Well, she's about 9 days old
They call her sweet little mama


Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
I'll not say my last good bye
Whoa, so don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
'cause I'll return someday
So don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' no, no don't weep
My heart tells me you're in love with me
Whoa, so don't weep, don't weep, little darlin' don't weep
'cause I'll return someday soon
(to take you in my arms) and to squeeze you tight
(to capture all your charms) every, every, every day now
Don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' no don't cry
I'm not saying my last good bye
Whoa, no don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't cry
I'll return someday, someday soon (someday soon)
Whoa, don't cry, don't cry, little darlin' don't, don't you cry
'cause I'm not saying my last good bye
Whoa, don't cry, no, no, no, don't cry


Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Oh why she's never on time
She should have been here since a quarter 'til nine
What could be keeping her so long
Well is she in another mans arms
Do we still have our date
I won't know until it's too late
Could be my bad luck
Maybe she done stood me up
She thinks that I'm lame
The way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Oh why, she haven't got here yet
She's the meanest girl I've ever met
Could she still be at home
I think I'll try to call her on the phone
Her mother answered the phone
And said that she had already gone
I should let her go
But oh, I love her so
She thinks that I'm lame
But the way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Oh why she's never on time
She should have been here since a quarter 'til nine
What could be keeping her so long
Oh, is she in another mans arms
Do we still have our date
I won't know until it's too late
Could be my bad luck
Maybe she done stood me up
She thinks that I'm lame
The way she treats me's a crying shame
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane
Between the ticks of the clock and the beats of my heart
It's about to drive me insane


For every boy, there's a girl
And I know somewhere in this world
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me, for me
I pray at night alone in my sleep
That someday my lover I'll meet
'cause I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
There must be somebody for me, for me
I pray at night that you'll come back to me
I love you with all my heart and soul
Darling, I would never make you cry
I want you to come to my side
For every boy there's a girl
And I know somewhere in this world
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me, for me
There must be somebody
There must be somebody, for me


Train whistle blowin' around the bend
But I can hear it comin' in
That's the train my baby's on
But now she's gonna bring her home
Got a letter yesterday
This is what she had to say
Meet me at the station a quarter to ten
Let's try it over again
Waitin' at the station happy as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My lonely nights are over from this day on
Since my baby's coming back home
The train pulled in a few minutes late
But I didn't mind that little wait
That train is carrying medicine for heartaches and pain
For this lonely man
Everybody's gettin' off one by one
Tellin' their friend where they've been and what they've done
But where is my girl, everybody's off the train
She made a fool of me again
Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby, now
My nights will still be lonely on and on
Since my baby didn't come home
Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My nights will still be lonely, on and on
Since my baby didn't come home
Waitin' at the station sad as can be, now
Waitin' at the station for my baby
My nights will still be lonely, on and on
Since my baby didn't come home


Once again, 
Here am I wrapped up in a dream, I'm about to lose my mind 
Over you, I've done it again 
Once again, 
I sit alone wondering and worrying all night long 
Over you, I've done it again 
I've been in love before 
I've been hurt before 
I thought I was through with being a fool 
But I ended in the same shoes once more 
Once again, 
I sit alone wondering and worrying all night long 
Over you, I've done it again 
I've done it again 
You know, I know I've done it again 
Over you, I've done it again


Why torture yourself, when you know you're in love
Throw your pride in the ocean and be happy beneath the stars above
Confess your feelings to the one's you love
And let's live, before it's too late
Let's live
Why deprive yourself, of the wonders of life
Time is getting shorter, there's no reason for those lonely nights
If you don't, if you don't love me, you'll miss the boat
And let's live, before it's too late
Let's live
Why should you live in a sad state of mind
Problems, problems, problems all the time
Do your best to get them off your chest
Everything, everything will be just fine
Love is nice , love is sometimes cruel
When you've been in love you have been to the greatest school
So try and make an "a" honey, and I'll do the same
Let's live, before it's too late
Let's live, before it's too late
You know, I know, before it's too late
So, come on, come on, come on
Let's live


What has happened down here
Is the winds have changed
Clouds roll in from the north
And it started to rain
It rained real hard, and
It rained for a real long time
Six feet of water
In the streets of Evangeline
The river rose all day
The river rose all night
Some people got lost in the flood
Some people got away alright
The river had busted through
Clear down to Plaquemine
Six feet of water
In the streets of Evangeline
Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
Oh Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
President Coolidge come down
In a railroad train
With his little fat man
With a note pad in his hand
President says "little fat man
Oh isn't it a shame
What the river has done
To this poor farmer's land"
Oh Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
You're trying to wash us away
Oh Louisiana, oh Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away
Oh Lord, they're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away


Ok, so your heart is broken 
You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin' 
You say you even think about dying 
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, dig this 
Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 
Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do 
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you 
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be 
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion 
Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 
How can you help it, when the music starts to play 
And your ability to reason, is swept away 
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality 
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you 
Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime 
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby 
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again, 
Everybody plays the fool 
Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 
Every plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I wanna say it again 
Everybody plays the fool


Down here the river meets the sea
In the sticky heat I feel you open up to me
Love comes out of no where, baby, oh, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Lying underneath the stars right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are, and how do you do, how do you do baby
Oh, the clouds roll in across the moon, and the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
We never gonna make that bridge tonight, baby
Set across the Pontchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Batten down the hatches, baby
Leave your heart out on your sleeve
Looks like we're in for stormy, stormy, stormy weather
That ain't no cause to leave
Just like
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Baby can you feel it, can you feel it
It feels like rain
Baby can you feel it, can you feel it
Feels like rain
Let your love, let your love come down
Oh, down on me


Must be a million girls in this great big city
I know that one of them is just right for me
I've looked uptown, downtown, all around searchin'
I know she's out there waiting for me
Somewhere, somebody, lookin', longin'
Somewhere, somebody, waitin' for me
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world can this girl be
You know street lights shine in those passin' faces
I keep tryin' to catch somebody's eye
But all the shoulda been's, the woulda been's, the mighta been's and the coulda been's
Slippin' away and just walk right on by
Somewhere, somebody, lookin', longin'
Somewhere, somebody, waitin' for me
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world can this girl be
I walk in the rain that's fallin'
Some voice in the distance callin', why
I run to the empty doorway waitin' for the sun to shine
When will love be mine
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world
Somewhere, somebody, searchin', prayin'
Tell me where in the world
Must be a million girls in this great big city
I know you're out there waiting for me


Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
If I got on my knees and pleaded with you
Not to go, but to stay in my heart
Would you walk out the door
Like you did once before
But this time be different and please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go
If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone with my tears
Knowing i, I need you so
Would you still turn and go
But this time be different in some way
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
You took me away from the rest of the world
When you taught me to love you like this
Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
But I still can be saved by your kiss
If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone with my tears
Knowing i, I need you so
Would you still turn and go
But this time be different and please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay
Don't go, please stay


With you in mind, things just ain't bad as they seem
With you in mind, I can fill my wildest dreams
With you in mind, I can do anything, I know I can
With you in mind
With you in mind
With you in mind, I went out looking for the best
With you in mind, cause you deserve nothing less
With you in mind, I've done so many things that love can bring
With you in mind
With you in mind
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
Or the same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day
Like a flower drinking from the falling rain
The same rain that could wash it away
Gives it strength, gives it water
And before you know, another day


With her mind far away from mine
She's mostly sincere most of the time
Yeah
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves

Oppression to her, is like a disease

That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
Many times when she's alone
She dreams and dreams and dreams
Dreaming of a perfect love
That never was, and would never be
With her heart placed in her hand
She will go to the end and back if she can for me
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves
That's the way she loves, that's the way she loves
That's the way she loves

They can come take it all away
Break you heart by the light of day
Drown your love in a distant bay so lonely
See the ships heading for the rocks
See the time melting over the clocks
There's a light shadows all the rocks that saves me
It saves me

On the night wind that takes me just where I want
That's all I want
La vie dansante
Miss the beat if you close your eyes
Every night wears a new disguise
And I live when a new surprise surrenders
Feel it all with a willing heart
Every stop, there's a place to start

I play with feeling
Why don't you wander and follow la vie dansante
On the night wind that takes you just where you want
That's all you want
La vie dansante

Oh, baby, I found heaven when I found you 
And this heaven is somethin' I don't wanna lose 
I only know that if you ever said goodbye, I couldn't stand the pain 
These eyes would cry, cry, cry like the rain 
And the sun would have nowhere to shine 
And the stars would all fall from the sky 
Baby, please 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 
'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know 
And I'd lose my whole world if you go 
Baby, don't 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 
Oh, baby, I saw forever when I saw you 
And if you left me, I can't imagine what I'd do 
Now that I've gone and built my world around your love, I couldn't let you go 
Don't ever say goodbye, no, don't, don't, don't ever go 
'Cause the sun would have nowhere to shine 
And the stars would all fall from the sky 
Baby, please 
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no 
'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know) 
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go) 
Baby, please

There's a chill in the evening air
Carries me back to some place where
I thought I'd lost my way forever
Every dream and every plan
Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over
Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending
Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right
But I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
One for life and one for love
And all you've given me
For the dreams you made me dream again
And all that we can be
Holding you tonight, holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one


Just a minute 'fore you leave girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you're trying to achieve girl
Do you think we can talk about it some more
You know the streets are filled with vipers
Who've lost all ray of hope
You know it ain't even safe no more
In the palace of the pope
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you
Come over here from over there girl
Sit down here you can have my chair
I can't see you going anywhere girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I can't take you there
Oh, I wish I'd a been a doctor
Maybe I'd a saved some lives that've been lost
Maybe I'd a done some good in this world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you
Oh, I wish I'd a been a doctor
Maybe I'd a saved some lives that've been lost 
Maybe I'd a done some good in this world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you 
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it's suppose to be
And I need you
(Don't fall apart on me tonight)
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Don't fall apart on me tonight


You are my brother, you are my family
And it seems like only yesterday, we were running wild and free
Down the corner buying candy, or messin' 'round in the neighborhood
Hanging out with you night and day, it was good, so good
Lately I've heard you've got the weight of the world on your shoulder
Times have been rough, I can't turn the other way
My brother, my brother, whatcha gonna do
My brother, my brother, here to help you
Tell me your sorrows, tell me your fears
My brother, my brother, I'll always be here
I know that we are different, and we've gone our separate way
But we've got to learn to accept each other, for who we are today
I know it won't be easy, but we both have got to try
To hold onto each other, until the day we die
Nobody knows you quite the way that I do
And if you're in trouble, come to me, come to me
My brother, my brother, whatcha gonna do
My brother, my brother, I'm here to help you
Tell me your sorrows, tell me your fears
My brother, my brother, I'll always be here
Whatcha gonna do
I'm here to help you
Tell me
We got the same blood running through our veins, my brother
Father is the heaven, mother is the grave
We gotta look out for each other, my brother
Yeah, that's what we gotta do
Tell me
My brother, my brother, whatcha gonna do
My brother, my brother, here to help you
Tell me your sorrows, tell me your fears
My brother, my brother, I'll always be here
My brother, my brother, whatcha gonna do
My brother, my brother, I'm here to help you
Tell me your sorrows, tell me your fears
My brother, my brother, I'll always be here
My brother, my brother, whatcha gonna do
My brother, my brother, here to help you
Tell me your sorrows, tell me your fears
My brother, my brother, I'll always be here


There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairy tales come true
But they come true, when I'm near you
You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise, and
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
If I could, I'd catch a falling star
To shine on you so I'll know where you are
All the rainbows in your favorite shades
To show I love you, thinking of you
Write your name across the sky
Anything you ask, I'll try
'cause betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever
And ever will my love for you, keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever
And ever will my love for you, keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever
And ever will my love for you, keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for, forever
And ever will my love for you, keep growing strong
Keep growing strong


There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story, long ago
She saw the queen of heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul
No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
But there were sorrows to be healed
And mercy, mercy in this world
So many hearts I find
Broken like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you
Won't you let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do
We've been around we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we mostly run
And every no and then, we try
To mend the damage that we've done
Tonight, tonight I cannot rest
I've got this joy inside breast
To think that I did not forget
That child, that song of Bernadette
So many hearts I find
Broken like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you
Come on let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do
I just want to hold you
Won't you let me hold you?
Like Bernadette would do


It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well
You could see that pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment with a two room roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with tv dinners and ginger ale,
But when pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records, all rock, and rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell
They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53,
Drove down to new orleans to celebrate the anniversary
It was there where pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell
They had a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well
You could see that pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell
"c'est la vie", say the old folks, it go to show you never can tell


I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells
I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells
Do you hear what I hear
Your lips are kissing mine
Can you hear the bells darling
Can you hear them when I'm kissing you
What do I have to do to make you feel the tingling too
Can you hear the bells darling
Can you hear them when I'm kissing you
Oh yeah
Oh, I hear the bells, ringing in my ear
Tell me do you love me, do you love me, do you love me, do you love me like I love you
Oh, it's one thing that I want you to remember
If you ever leave me I believe I'll go insane
And I'll never hear the bells again
No, I'll never hear the bells again
No, I'll never hear the bells again


A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground painted swing
These foolish things remind me of you
You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me, I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of march that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings, but who's to answer
How the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me, they seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations,
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you


You know night after night these guys are setting up, hooking up,
Climbing past the sky. they don't really get no praise,
So I wrote this song in honor of them,
'cause without them there'd be no show.
So get a roadie song, after all he ain't no bum
Give a roadie a hand, he's really part of the band
Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song
Them speakers weigh a ton
His work is never done
So get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song
Got a mighty long ways to travel
He's gotta cover many miles of gravel
He's gotta long long ways to go
And if he don't make it, there ain't gonna be no show
So give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie song
He climbed to kingdom come
He's up to see the sun
Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song
He's got a mighty long ways to travel
He's gotta cover many miles of gravel
He's gotta long long ways to go
And if he don't make it, there ain't gonna be no show
Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song, after all he ain't no bum
And get a roadie a hand, he's really part of the band
Give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie song
Get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie, get a roadie song
Give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give a roadie song
Give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give the roadie, give a roadie song


Ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me
I know that a mans duty is to have and love a woman
And that's the way it was planned
Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands
It ain't no way, it ain't no way, just ain't no way, ain't no way baby
It ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me
Stop trying to be someone you're not
The hard cold truth is, woman, you paid too much for what you got
And if you need me, baby, say, say you do,
Baby, I, baby, baby, don't you know that I need you
It ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way, it ain't no way, it ain't no way baby, baby, baby, baby
Just ain't no way, sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me


Step right up come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of the lonely house that once was
Home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you
To the bone
Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
Sit down on my knee and whisper
Oh, I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house it will never
Be the same without the love
That we once knew
Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we'd lie in love together
And Lord knows we had
A good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say
Good mornin' dear
There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Where she left them when
She tore my world apart
As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Takin' nothin' but our baby
And my heart
Step right up come on in
Come on in


Our father
Which art in heaven.
Hollowed would be thy name
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive our debts
As we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
And the power, and the glory.
Forever and ever. amen.


Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news 
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues 
My baby's gone, I have no friends 
To wish me greetings once again 
Choirs will be singing Silent Night 
Christmas carols, by candle light 
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Years night
Friends and relations, send salutations 
Sure as the stars shine above 
But this is Christmas
Yeah, it's Christmas my dear 
It's the time of year to be with, with the one you love 
So won't you tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow 
No grief and pain 
And I'll be happy, happy, once again
Interlude 
Ooo, there'll be no more sorrow 
No grief and pain 
And I'll be happy, Christmas, once again


Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from orient land
The king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.
Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and his gospel is peace
Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise his holy name.


Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos.
Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.
They know that santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly.
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry christmas to you.


Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you really, really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in a storm
But if you really, really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.


Twas the night before christmas all white with snow
I was lying back waiting for my baby to show
I was searching my mind for the right things to say
'cause she had to leave the very next day
When out on the driveway I heard such a clatter
I dimmed all the lights and put on clyde mcphatter
And she came to the doorway and she gave me a kiss
And the rest of the night went something like this.....
It was a night
Oo what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
The moon was bright
Oo how bright it was, it really was
Such a night
The night was alive
With the stars above
Oo when she kissed
I had to fall in love.
Oo it was a kiss
Oo what a kiss it was, it really was
Such a kiss
How she could kiss!
Oo what a kiss it was, it really was
Such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips sets me afire
I reminisce, I'm filled with desire.
And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender (doo wah, doo wah)
Oh how I remember! (doo wah, doo wah)
I'll always remember...(doo wah, doo wah)
Oo that night
Oo what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night were gone
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight
Oo such a kiss
Oo such a night
And I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender (doo wah, doo wah)
Oh how I remember! (doo wah, doo wah)
I'll always remember (doo wah, doo wah)
Oo that night
Oo what a night it was, it really was
Such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night were gone
But I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight
Oo such a kiss
Oo such a night
Well it's now christmas morning and my baby's gone
So I light up the tree and turn the radio on
I sit down in my chair and let out a sigh
I sang away in a manager and angels on high
Now my family and friends will soon knock on my door
So I'll say merry christmas to you and to yours
May your days be cheerful and your burdens be light
Oh but mostly I wish everyone such a night
Now she's gone, gone, gone
Yeah she's gone, gone, gone
And the dawn, dawn, dawn
And the night was gone
And my heart was gone
And her love was gone
And before the dawn
Oh oh oh
Such a night!!


O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth
O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide in us
Our lord, Emmanuel
O come to us, abide in us
Our lord, Emmanuel


Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright.
Round yon virgin, mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild,
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight.
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia,
Christ the savior is born!
Christ the savior is born.
Silent night, holy night!
Son of God love's pure light.
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus lord, at thy birth.
Jesus lord, at thy birth.


I'm a family man
I wasn't born to roam
But it seems like every Christmas time
It makes me farther from my home
I love singin' my song, but it get's me down
To hang my stockin' in some hotel
When the fat man comes to town
But, it's alright, it's gonna to be okay
This year I'll be home come a Louisiana Christmas day
Oh, mama, I'm gonna find a way
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
Way up in the bayou there won't be snow
But my friends all envite my 'round
For a Christmas fay do-do
I'm gonna hop a plane or use my thumb
But you best believe I'll be 'round that tree
When Christmas morning comes
Oooh, it's alright, it's gonna to be okay
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
Your little boy comin' on home to the Louisiana Christmas day
But, it's alright (alright)
It's gonna be okay (gonna be okay)
I'll be home (I'll be home)
Come a Louisiana Christmas day

For the Louisiana Christmas day


Long years ago, on a deep winter night.
High in the heavens, a star shone bright.
While in the manger, a wee baby lay.
Sweetly asleep, on a bed of hay.
Jesus our Lord, was that baby so small.
Lay down to sleep, in a humble stall.
Then came the star, and it stood over head.
Shedding its light, 'round his little head.
Dear baby Jesus, how tiny thou art.
I'll make a place, for thee in my heart.
And when the stars, in the heavens I see.
Ever and always, I'd think of thee...


The bells of St. Mary's, 
Ah! here they are calling, 
The young loves, and the true loves, 
That come from the sea ...
And so my beloved, 
When The red leaves are falling, 
The love bells shall ring out, yes ring out, 
For you, yes you and me! 
The bells of St. Mary's,

The love bells shall ring out, yes ring out, 
For you and me!


Hey...hey...hey...whoa...whoa...
Oh...
You can think that I'm just playin' games
You can think I'll do you wrong
You can think that I don't mean a word I say
You can think what you want (What you want)
But if you think you're gonna stop the way
I feel about you
Baby, you're just wastin' your time
'Cause I'm not changing my mind
Can't stop the rain from falling down, oh
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round, oh
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby
You can trust that I'm gonna stay around
You can trust I'll treat you right (I treat you right)
You can be sure that I won't ever let you down
Sure as there are stars in the night (In the night)
And if you ever think there'll come a day
I'll live without you

Can't change the way that I feel

And I'll always need you here in my life
Oh, oh, oh
Can't stop my love, can't stop my heart

Never gonna stop, never gonna stop
Lovin' you, oh, oh, oh

I've tried my best for so long
To break down these walls
But you build them strong
So I stand here waiting, wondering why
Oh why
Why you don't give a little bit
Break down and give a little bit
Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart,
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now
You say you've been hurt
Well you're not alone
As you race through this life
What you keep to yourself
Can turn you to stone
All it would take is one kind word
To be heard
Come on and give a little bit
Try to forgive a little bit
Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now
Show, show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now
Show some emotion
Open, open your heart
Set free an ocean
Only a feeling can save us now


One lonely night, has stumbled upon a dream
In my ordinary world, with eyes like an angel
A voice like a song from the heart
You came into my world, you crossed the river of time
You climbed the mountain of hope, yes you did
You brought me all the love that I've been living for
And now I can only ask for one thing more
Just to have and to hold you
Inspire and console you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day
I want to love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day of my life
Just like the stars shinning down from the heavens
Into my solitary world
Just like the glow that comes when the rain is over
Bringing warmth to the world
You are the dawn of my days, yes you are
You are the lantern that lights my way
You are the love that I cherish in my heart
I prayed to heaven that we never part
I want to have and to hold you
Inspire and console you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day
I want to love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day
Every day I thank heaven for you
Every night I pray just to
Just to have and to hold you
Inspire and console you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day
I want to love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Be with you every day of my life
Have and to hold you
Be with you every day
Love and adore you
Do anything for you
And be with you every day
(Be with you every day)
Have and to hold you


Now you left me here and went out on the town
I don't know when I've been so down
The sky is dark,
The moon is blue
I don't know what I'm gonna do
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water
Well the national anthem has come and gone,
I still got the tv on,
And white noise,
A blue moon,
Sitting here waiting up on you,
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water
The clock on the wall keeps rollin' on,
2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5
Baby, you still ain't home
Well, I've fought some sleep, in a straight back chair
Morning comes and you still ain't here,
Roll on, I've had enough,
Holding on to faithless love,
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water.
The clock on the wall keeps rollin' on,
2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5
And baby, you still ain't home,
Now you left me here and went out on the town,
I don't know when I've been so down,
The sky is dark,
The moon is blue,
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water
It's like I'm falling down into muddy water
I'm falling down into muddy water
I'm falling down into muddy water
I'm falling down into muddy water
I'm falling down into muddy water
I'm falling down into muddy water


We held each other 'til the moon was high
We waved that sleepy little town good bye
And driving off together we crossed our hearts
Living for the promise that love would keep us honest
I said I'd be yours if you'd be mine
We were crazy baby
And every day the sun was sure to shine
But it tried and tried
Sometimes the wind makes a sudden change
And some days are made for rain
We fixed a tire and we drove like hell
We kissed like fire in a cheap motel
I never felt the hunger so bad before
Holding you beside me
Walls came down inside me
And I thought I was yours and you were mine
That was crazy baby
I was sure the sun would always shine
But it tried and tried
Sometimes the wind makes a sudden change
And some days are made for rain
You want to talk about love
I'll tell you all about love
Nothing but trouble
On top of falling
One day you're walking on air
Next day you look and there's no one there
She never cared
She never cared
Now I've been sleeping with the tv on
I get so tired of wondering where you've gone
You tore across my heart across like a hurricane
I'm counting up the damage
Trying hard to manage
I thought I was yours and you were mine
That was crazy baby
And I was sure the sun would always shine
But take a look outside
Sometimes a wind makes a sudden change
Here comes those clouds and they're full of pain
Some days are made for rain
Some days are made for rain
Let it pour outside
Some days are made for rain
Some days are made for rain


Sometimes we need to start again 
When this crazy life of ours is slow 
And I guess that's why fools like us rush in 
Where wise men never never go 
In time we may find out why 
These walls we build seem so high 
But I've gotta believe that we can break through 
And I gotta believe this love is good for me and you 
And all we have to do to make it last, oh yeah 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it groove is try a little harder, try a little harder 
You're the wildfire in my life 
Always burning out of my control 
Sometimes you cut me like a knife 
Deep into my heart 
Way down to my soul 
But somehow we survive 
And we get another chance to make it right 
But I gotta believe that we know which path to choose 
And I gotta believe that somehow we will see it through 
All we have to do to make it last 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it groove 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
Each precious moment that we share 
Is locked up in my heart forever more 
I just need to know that you really care 
When you touch my hand 
Swear I'm gonna fall apart 
All we have to do to make it last 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it groove 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder 
All we have to do to make it last 
Is try a little harder, try a little harder


I thought it would rain forever
Caught in the flood
Reaching for some high ground
Just before I went down
It's hard for me to remember
Just how I got through
Now I'm lying on the cool sand
Happy here where I am
I look up
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night
The rolling of distant thunder
Trouble ahead
Now don't you be afraid now
We'll get through it somehow
Just look up
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night
Some like burning all night long
Some like howling at the moon
Some just like to sing along
Cause we get lonely, lonely, we get so lonely
The stars in the sky above me
Can make me forget everything but you babe, everything but you
I look up
See your shining smile
And I know it'll be all right
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night
Just look up,
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain. let it rain
It's gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be


So many special reasons we are here, so in love
I feel so blessed because I know that we're in this love
You are the sun that lights the sky, you are the only one I need in my life
Cause you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart, and I will respect this love forever
Yours is the sweetest song I've ever heard, or ever knew
I can't imagine living in this world, without you
I never thought that I could feel something so wonderful, something so real
Cause you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart, and I will respect this love forever
Nothing is stronger than our love, nothing lasts longer than this love
Nothing is deeper than, sweeter than, loving you
Cause you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart, and I will respect this love forever
And you are my precious star, wherever you are, I want to be there
And you've got all of my heart


Why should I fall in love
Turn my world upside down
One broken heart is quite enough
Why should I fall in love
Why should I hold your hand
Feel my hopes start to rise
It's a long way down and I can't fly
Why should I fall in love
Why should I hold you
Why should I dream
I know myself, I'll just take it to extremes
I want to keep you my whole life through
If you've got no one, least you've got no one to lose
Why should I fall in love
Wake up tomorrow with a smile
I want the kind that lasts awhile
Why should I fall in love
Tell me baby
Why should I hold you
Why should I dream
I know myself, I'll just take it to extremes
I wanna keep you my whole life through
But if you've got no one, least you've got no one to lose
Why should I fall in love
Turn my life inside out
One broken heart is quite enough
Why should I fall in love
This old heart has had it rough
Why should I fall in love


Well, my friends feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me
But my answer to all that use me stuff
Is that I, I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up
But my brother
You know he sit me right down and he talked to me
Well, he told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me
But I'm sure he meant well
You know, but when our talk was through
I had to say, now brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
Whoa, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up
But sometimes, it's true you really do abuse me
Well, you get me in a crowd of high-class people
And then you act real rude to me
But, oh baby, baby, baby, baby
When you love me, I can't get enough
And I, said I want to spread the news
That if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up
Talkin' 'bout you using me
And It all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're using me
Cause I sure am using you to do the things you do
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Baby, just a keep on using
Until you use me up
Until you use me up
Baby....
Until you use me up
Get funky....
Until you use me up
Until you use me up


Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times.
I'll get along, and you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times


I can see it in your eyes,
You're telling me a lie when you said you loved me
And there's something in your smile,
Said you'd be gone in awhile,
So how can you love me
I can hear it in your talk,
You're about to take a walk,
So darlin' please don't lie,
I've been knowing you way too long,
So don't say there's nothing wrong,
You could never fool me, know how
I can see it in your eyes,
What you're trying to disguise,
I can feel it in your touch,
You've fallen out of love,
You could tell me that I'm wrong,
My heart knows I'm right,
I can see it in your eyes
So if it's over, let it be over,
I'd rather face the truth than have to make believe your feelings haven't changed,
Yes, I'll be all right,
After you say good bye,
And I know that I'll be missing you, for a long long time.
I can see it in your eyes,
What you're trying to disguise,
I can feel it in your touch,
You've fallen out of love,
You could tell me that I'm wrong,
My heart knows I'm right,
I can see it in your eyes
You could tell me that I'm wrong,
My heart knows I'm right
I can see it in your eyes


You saw me crying in the chapel,
Tears I shed were tears of joy,
I know the meaning of contentment,
I am happy with the lord
Just a plain and simple chapel,
Where all good people go to pray,
I pray the lord that I'll grow stronger,
As I live from day to day
I've searched, and I've searched, but I couldn't find
Nowhere on earth to find peace of mind,
Now I'm happy in the chapel,
Where people are of one heart,
Yes we gather in the chapel,
Just to sing and praise the lord
You'll search and you'll search but you never find,
Nowhere on earth to find peace of mind,
Take your troubles to the chapel,
Get down on your knees and pray,
Then your burdens will be lightened,
And you'll surely find the way.


My eyes can't lie to you
My kiss my kiss can only tell you true now
You say you have your doubts
But I say I don't know what that talks about now
My world, I have given you
I never gave myself the way I gave myself to you
What have I gotta do to make you believe I love you
What have I gotta say to make you believe you're the one for me
Didn't you hold me last night
Didn't you look in my eyes
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart
Didn't my heart tell you true, that I could only love you
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart
When I say I love you, I say what's in my heart
There is no other love
I know that God knows you're the only one so
Why can't you believe when I tell you there ain't nobody
There ain't nobody but you in my heart
Long as we've been together
You should know by now the love I feel, I feel forever
What have I gotta do to make you believe I love you
What have I gotta say to make you believe you're the one for me,
Didn't you hold me last night
Didn't you look in my eyes
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart
Didn't my heart tell you true, that I could only love you
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart
When I say I love you I say what's in my heart
I'll never walk away, I'll never leave your side,
I'll never break your heart looking in someone else's eyes
Your the one I need, the air that I breathe
I won't live one day without you, believe me
Didn't you hold me last night,
Didn't you look in my eyes,
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart,
Didn't my heart tell you true, that I could only love you
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart
When I say I love you I say what's in my heart
Didn't you hold me last night,
Didn't you look in my eyes,
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart,
Didn't my heart tell you true, that I could only love you
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart,
Didn't you hold me last night
Didn't you look in my eyes
Didn't I, didn't I say what's in my heart

Oh Amelia, oh Amelia
A southern woman, a southern woman
Never had a chance to say goodbye
I met her back in sixty-three, she was such a mystery
She was there on barron street, down in new orleans
So wild, but yet so tame, she could calm a hurricane
She was only seventeen and Amelia was her name
Oh when I took her for a ride, she got close by my side
And when I looked into her eye, Amelia kept me hypnotized
But in my heart she fell, oh I got pulled into her spell
I can still see her there, with the flowers in her hair
Oh Amelia, my southern woman, oh my woman
I can still feel you, feel you, feel you, everytime I close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye
Never heard her say goodbye
I remember making love underneath the stars above
I can feel the summer breeze up in magnolia trees
That night in the southern light, the girl she took me by the hand
I was weak as a little lamb, but I became a man
Love was pumping through my veins, her lips were sweet like sugarcane
We rode all night in the rain, 'cross lake poncetrain
She had a heart as fine as fire, burning innocent desire
I can still see her there, with flowers in her hair
Oh Amelia, oh Amelia
A southern woman, a southern woman
I can still feel you, everytime I close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to, where'd you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye
Never want to say goodbye
Just like a shooting star, she vanished in the night
But I'll always remember her lips so warm and tender
And in my heart she'll always shine so bright
Sweet Amelia, if I could just see her one more time
Oh Amelia, my southern woman
A southern woman,
I can still feel you, oh I can feel you, everytime I close my eyes, close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye (never, never, never, never never say goodbye)
Oh Amelia, oh Amelia
A southern woman, a southern woman
I can still feel you, everytime I close my eyes
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye
Oh Amelia, a southern woman,
A southern woman
I can still feel you, everytime I close my eyes, from the bottom of my heart
Sweet Amelia, sweet Amelia,
Where did you run to
Where did you run to
We never had a chance to say goodbye


I've walked through this world sometimes without a friend
My life has been up and down, been close to an end
But I've been through the mill
And I've paid my dues
Walked so many miles in different peoples shoes
But I've been through the fire
And I've walked in the rain
I've felt the joy and endured the pain
Once I was a schemer
But I always was a dreamer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am
I've met a lot of lost souls in the bowels of hell
Traveled some crooked roads, got some stories yet to tell
I've shot up with the junkie, in piss stench halls
Broken bread with the devil, fallen on my knees to god
Some days I was blessed, some nights I was damned
But I always tried to lend a helping hand
Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am
Oh, I've seen the little children, all strung out on dope
No one to care about them, living without hope
But I've been lucky that I always had a song
I'll sing it with compassion, to try to right the wrong.
Once my life was wretched
But why should I regret it
'cause, it took me who I was, and where I've been
To make me who I am[Speech:]
This is dedicated to my friends in jail
For my brother jake who had to ride the rail
For my friend roonie and melvin, who were so dear
They were so misunderstood
But I wish they were still here
To hear this song I sing from my heart
They're forever in my soul, even though we had to part
Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am
God said I forgive you
Wipe away the scars
Cause I know it took who you were
And where you came from
To make you who you are
Cause I know it took who you were
And where you came from
To make you what you are


The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love,
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth,
I felt the earth move in my hand,
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love,
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy it would fill the earth
And would last til the end of time, my love,
It would last til the end of time
The first time ever I saw, saw your face
Your face, your face, your face, your face


I'm changing my mind,
Never gonna learn about how to feel again
Cause you, you've opened my heart,
And I just can't hide, I love you still.
I know you mean it, when you say you need me,
You say you won't leave me, you'll always be here,
You won't regret it, cause I'll never leave you,
And I won't deceive you, I need you too,
Yes, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Yes, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Oh I do, girl, I love you
We belong together, loving forever, enjoying this life,
We'll do what's right, we'll do it tonight, will you be my wife
I know you mean it, when you say you need me, won't ever leave me,
Saying you'll be right here my baby,
You won't regret it, no, don't you forget it,
I'll never deceive you, I need you too.
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,
Yes, I love you, I love you,
I love you
Forgive me for what I've put you through,
I'm learning to put my trust in you,
Believe in me and I'll show you,
Cause I'll always be here,
I love you
I love you baby, oh I love you baby, I love you,
I love you, from the bottom of my heart girl,
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you
I love you, love you, love you, love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, love you, I love you,
Oh believe me darling


Looking in your eyes 
Is like looking through a window seeing clear skies of days gone by 
Of happiness, imaginning sweet visions of your loveliness 
Oh and your tenderness 
Makes me want to cry, for the love that we've shared 
It makes me feel alive to know that you care 
Hold you through the night, let me lie in your arms 
Tonight I want to love you girl til the morning comes and look into your eyes 
Your sweet and smiling eyes 
Take me to paradise 
It makes me want to cry tears of joy 
Whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes 
When I see your face, oh and you hold me in your warm embrace 
I feel so safe 
Your amazing grace calms me through the fire 
Or the rainy days and the clouds it brings 
Makes me want to cry, for the love that we've shared 
It makes me feel alive to know that you care 
Hold you through the night let me lie in your arms 
Tonight I want to love you girl 'til the morning comes 
And look into your eyes 
Your sweet and smiling eyes, hold me darling 
Take me to paradise 
Your an angel, it makes me want to cry 
Tears of joy whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes 
Could you be an angel from up above, from up above 
So beautiful, beautiful, wonderful 
Sent down from heaven for me to love 
Oh I love you girl 
Your sweet smiling eyes, 
Your sweet and smiling eyes 
Take me to paradise 
It makes me want to cry 
Tears of joy whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes, 
Sweet and smiling eyes 
Your sweet and smiling eyes, your sweet and smiling eyes 
Sweet and smiling eyes, take me to paradise, paradise 
It makes me want to cry, tears of joy 
Whenever I see your sweet and smiling eyes


I believed I could see a day you would want me, like I want you
You would need me, like I need you to
There was a moment I thought time might change your mind
And there'd be a place there for me in your life
But I can't change the way you don't feel
And I can't make you see what you're heart won't see
And I can't make you need what you say you don't need
I can't change you baby, I can't change the way you don't feel
And now as I walk away, I won't look back, I won't break down
What I was living for, I'll have to live without
There will be moments I'll think how it might have been
But baby now this is how it must end
Cause I can't change the way you don't feel
And I can't make you see what you're heart won't see
And I can't make you need what you say you don't need
I can't change you baby, I can't change the way you don't feel
No, I can't change the way you don't feel
And I can't make you see what you're heart won't see
And I can't make you need what you say you don't need
I can't change you baby
You never gonna change you baby, no
I can't change you baby, I can't change the way you don't feel


When all our tears have reached the sea,
A part of you will live in me,
Way down inside my heart.
The days keep coming without fail,
A new winds gonna find your sail,
And that's where your journey starts,
You'll find better love,
Strong as it ever was,
Deep as a river runs,
Warm as the morning sun.
Please remember me.
Just like the waves down by the shore,
We're gonna keep on coming back for more,
Cause we don't ever wanna stop.
Out in this brave new world you see,
Only the valleys and the peaks,
I can see you on the top,
You'll find better love,
Strong as it ever was,
Deep as a river runs,
Warm as the morning sun.
Please remember me.
Remember me when you're out walking,
When snow falls high outside your door,
Late at night when you're not sleeping,
And moonlight falls across your floor.
When I can't hurt you anymore,
You'll find better love,
Strong as it ever was,
Deep as a river runs,
Warm as the morning sun.
Please remember me.
Please remember me.


Unbelievable describes your smile so sweet 
Inconceivable that you're a part of me 
Innocent look in your eyes 
Love without compromise for me 
It's a mystery 
What did I do to deserve you 
Only God's hands could have made you 
And brought this dream to life 
Always swore that I, I would never fall 
I guess miracles happen after all 
What did I do to deserve you 
Oh Yeah 
Unconventional, describes my love for you 
Unconditional, cause there's nothing I won't do 
I pray as this feeling grows 
That you always touch the heart and soul of me 
It's a mystery 
What did I do to deserve you 
Only God's hand could have made you 
And brought this dream to life 
Always swore that I, I would never fall 
I guess miracles happen after all 
What did I do to deserve you 
I've waited all my life to hold such a treasure 
What is this feeling worth, there is no measure 
Tell me what can I do 
What did I do to deserve you 
Only God's hand could have made you 
And brought this dream to life 
Always swore that I'd, I would never fall 
I guess miracles happen after all 
What did I do to deserve you 
To deserve you


It must have taken a long long time to make a woman like you
Ooh baby, cause you're so, so fine
He took the stars from the sky, put the sparkle in your eye
Baby, don't you know, you're my only desire
When I enter the room, I smell your perfume
The taste of your lips is like the nectar from the gods
And the sunlight on your hair, is just like spun gold
After God made you, he broke the mold
God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
To describe how your body feels when you're next to me
Like rockin' and rollin' on a stormy, stormy sea
You bring me up, oh and then you take me down,
Then you take me to heaven and back down to the ground
You're just like a rose, blooming in the spring
You're everything a man could want
Everything a man could need
And at night I fall down, on my knees
And thank God for sending an angel, just to love me
God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
Girl, let me touch you, make sure it's not a dream
If it is please don't awake me, it would be so so mean
The thought of ever losing you is more than I could bear
It just wouldn't be heaven no more if you were not there
God made you for me, you're my dream come true
I don't want another woman, all I need is you
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
God made you for me (I thank God)
You're my dream come true (from high up above)
And I don't want another woman (for sending you to me)
All I need is you (for me to love)
You're everything to me, and my lifes complete
I'm gonna worship and adore you, I'm gonna bow to your feet
Cause I love you girl, oh I love you girl
All I need is you
You're everything to me
And my lifes complete


Lovely lady, dressed in blue, teach me how to pray
Cause God was just your little boy, and you know the way
Did you lift him up sometimes, gently on your knee
Did you tell him stories of the world, like mother did to me
And when he fell, did you lift him up, and make everything alright
And did you tell him his prayers at night
I wanna know my lovely lady, lovely lady, dressed, dressed in blue
Oh, God was just your little boy, your little boy and you know the truth
And did you whisper in his ear sweet lullabyes,
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, did he cry
Lovely lady, dressed in blue, oh won't you please teach me how to pray
Cause God was just your little boy, and
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, so teach me how to pray
Teach me how to pray


Jesus is a friend of mine
Jesus is a friend of mine
He saved my soul, renewed my mind
Jesus is a friend of mine
Everybody say ah, oop
When I'm weak He makes me strong
He is my shelter in the time of storm
When I'm weak He makes me strong
Everybody say ah, oop
He will never let me down
He is the best thing I've ever found
He will never let me down
A friend of mine
Jesus is a friend of mine
He saved my soul, renewed my mind
Jesus is a friend of mine
Everybody say ah, oop


When will we open our eyes
And finally discover
We are united by one blood? 
When will we realise
We're sisters and brothers
And what the world
Needs now is love? 
There's a dreamer inside
Each one of us
Who wants to believe
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
There is still a dream (oh)
(aah)
A brother down on his luck
Fallen to chances
We could pick the brother up
A sister down on her knees
Prayin' for answers
Why don't you show
The sister love? 
All over the world
Life is unjust
But I do believe
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
There is still a dream
And everyone needs one
'cause no one is freed from
The worries of life
That drag us down
If you can't make it
My hands can take it
We'll stand
Together and pray
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
(to show the world)
There is still a dream
To believe in
There is still a hope
After hope is gone
We could be
The father's hands
And give peace a chance
And show the world
(whoa-oh)
(to show the world)
There is still a dream
(there's still a dream)
There is still a dream (oh)


When you're weary,
feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes,
I will dry them all;
I'm on your side.
Oh when times get rough
And friends just can't be found,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
When you're down and out,
When you're on the street,.
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you.
I'll take your part.
Oh when darkness comes
And pain is all around,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Sail on silvergirl,
Sail on by.
Your time has come to shine.
All your dreams are on their way.
See how they shine.
Oh If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.


Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the word
Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall, on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass
Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's re-creation of the new day
Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the word


Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong
Sing, yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so
Jesus loves me, He who died
Heaven's gates to open wide
He will wash away my sins
And let his little child come in
Keep on singin' y'all
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so
Listen children, Jesus loves me
He will stay close beside me all the way
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high
Keep on singin' y'all
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so
Keep on singin' y'all
Yes, Jesus loves me
I know He loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so


They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man needs protection
They say every man, oh, must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Someplace so high above this wall 
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Now, yonder stands a man, oh, in this lonely crowd
He's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long, I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Oh, any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released


One of these mornings
I'm going away
Any day now
I'm going to Heaven to stay
I don't know how soon
Maybe morning, night or noon
But I'm going to see the Father
And by His side to stand
There'll be no sorrow, no sadness
Just only complete gladness
But any day now, I know that I
Know that I am going home
Then I'll shout Hallelujah
And give praises to His name
Pray any day now, I know that I
Know that I am going home


When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they may see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
(Let it be, let it be)
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
(Just let it be)
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
(Let it be, let it be, oh, let it be)
There will be an answer, let it be

I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way, I believe, I believe
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe
(Why I believe)

Hey, are you coming? Are you going?
Brother, are you just wasting time
Is there a rhyme or a reason
And when you're gonna make up your mind
Are you holding back your tears?
Will you ever let the river flow?
Or are you caught up in your fears?
Let the living water save your soul
Let go, let the mercy river flow
Let go, get on your knees and let Him know
Let go, He'll build you up and make you strong
All the saints will march in glory
Hear the angels sing along
And let go, just let go
I am with you on this journey
I'll be with you till the end of time
You know you'll never ever be abandoned
So precious, this child of mine
Jesus in my arms I will hold you
This world at times it seems so unkind
Walk with faith into His glory
Let go and let your spirit fly
Let go, let the mercy river flow
Let go, get on your knees and let Him know
Let go, He'll build you up and make you strong
All the saints will march in glory
Hear the angels sing along and let go
Don't you wanna be with your brothers
Marching with that angel band
And let go, just let go
Let go, let the mercy river flow
Let go, get on your knees and let Him know
Let go, He'll build you up and make you strong
All the saints will march in glory
Hear the angels sing along
Let go, let go, let it go
Let go, let it go
And let it go, let it go
Just let go, let it go
Let go


What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never, never, never be discouraged, oh no
Take, take it to the Lord, to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who with all our sorrows share?
Jesus know our every weakness
Take, take it to the Lord, to the Lord in prayer
Are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior still our refuge
Take, take it to the Lord in prayer
Do your friends despise or forsake you?
Take it to the Lord, take it to the Lord in prayer
In His arms He'll take you and shield you
You will find, you will find solace there


I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know
What's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
When I go to my brother, my brother, my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up knockin' me
Right down on my, on the knees
And there been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think
I'm able to carry on
It's been a long
A long, long time coming
Well, I know, I know change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
It's been a long
It's been a long, long time coming
Well, I know, I know, I know change gonna come
Oh, yes it will


I've wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I've walked in darkness and clouds covered me
I had no idea where the way out could be
Then came the sunrise and rolled back the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
And I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man who God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
When death takes me down and I breathe here no more
My anthem will sound on that eternal shore
When I join with angels in heaven on high
Singing 'Praise the Lord, yes, I saw the light'
Can you feel him shine on me
Can you feel him shine on me now?
Can you feel him shine on me?
Can you feel him shine, shine, shine?


Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once, I once was lost, oh,  now am found
I was blind, oh, but now I see
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have, I have already, already come
T'was grace that brought me safe this far
And grace shall lead me home
Our world shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, who called me here, here below
Will be forever mine


If I expected love when first we kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only just for you, I did exist
Blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child at three
You meant more than everything
All the world to me
If you were on my mind all night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first, I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart
Blame it on my youth
If you were on my mind all night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first, I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart
Blame it on my youth


The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream and I'm happy as a king
And foolish as it may seem to me that's everything
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you the very thought of you, my love
I'm living in a kind of daydream and I'm happy as a king
And foolish as it may seem to me that's everything
The mere idea of you, the mere idea of you
The longing here for you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
It's just the thought of you the very thought of you, my love


The Shadow of Your Smile
The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Your lovely smile
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Oh, the shadow of your smile


Cry Me A River
Now you say you're lonely
You cry the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
Na na na


There was a boy, a very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye, but very wise was he
And then one day, a magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things, fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"


Who will buy this wonderful morning?
Such a sky you never did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon?
And put it in a box for me
So I could see it at my leisure
Whenever things go wrong
And keep it as a treasure
To last my whole life long
Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep this sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy
Who will buy this wonderful morning...?
There'll never be a day so sunny
It could not happen twice
Where is the man with all the money?
It's cheap at half the price
Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep the sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy


I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be fine'
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in and out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you, rain or shine
You gotta love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be fine'
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in and out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine


In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you
In the still of the night
While the world is in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you
Do you love me, as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight
Like the moon glowing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, in the still of the night
Do you love me, as I love you
Are you my life to be, my dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight
Like the moon glowing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, in the still of the night
Of the night, of the night, of the night


When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so
And yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart
You may leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I know I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
First you love me
Then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm still in love with you
I, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you
I, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you


This is my wish for everybody in the world
To have peace and happiness
And all the love that they deserve
To every mother, every father
Every baby child [?]
This is my Christmas prayer
To all those who are hungry
May they never miss a meal
All the broken hearted may they find a way to heal
And all the homeless and the needy
That they might have a coat to wear
This is my Christmas prayer
From my little house upon Valance Street
I'm sending out these hopes to high above
That this whole earth just might someday be
A little better place for the human race
From Lafayette to London
From Buenos Aires to Beijing
Let's be kind to one another
And let that yuletide spirit ring
Spread the message and the meaning
Of the season everywhere
This is my Christmas prayer
From my little house upon Valance Street
I'm sending out these hopes to high above
That this whole earth just might someday be
A little better place for the human race
This is my wish, it may be a lot to ask
But I'm hoping that a miracle
Will finally come to pass
And that all that I am saying
Are just whispers in the air
This is my Christmas, this is my Christmas
This is my Christmas prayer


Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I say go
Tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds
Kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light
Go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Down in that lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
God sent to us salvation
Born that Christmas morn
Hey go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
I said go
Tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
I say go
Tell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on that mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Hey go
Ttell it on that mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
I said go
Tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born


Long time ago
In Bethlehem
So the
Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child
Jesus Christ
Was born
On Christmas day
Hark
Now hear
The angels sing
A King
Was born today
And man will live
For evermore
Because
Of Christmas Day
While shepherds
Watch
Their flocks
By night
They see
A bright new
Shining star
They hear a choir
Sing a song
The music seemed
To come from afar
Now Joseph
And his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem
That night
They found no place
To bear her child
Not a single room
Was in sight
Hark
Now hear
The angels sing
A King
Was born today
And man will live
For evermore
Because
Of Christmas day
Mary's boy child
Jesus Christ
Was born
On Christmas day
And then
They found
A little nook
In a stable
All forlorn
And in a manger
Cold and dark
Mary's little boy
Was born
Hark
Now hear
The angels sing
A King
Was born today
And man will live
For evermore
Because
Of Christmas day
Mary's boy child
Jesus Christ
Was born
On Christmas Day


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.

The First Noel
The angels did say
Was to certain
Poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they may
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel
They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel
Then entered
In those Wise men three
Full reverently
Upon their knee
And offered there
In His presence
Their gold and myrrh
And frankincense
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel

It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing
Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
Above it's sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er it's Babel sounds the blessed angels sing
Blessed angels sing
O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
And hear the angels sing


Amen
Sleeping little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas morning
Singing in the temple
Talking with the elders
Tomorrow there's wisdom
Down at the Jordan
John was babtizing
And saving all the sinners
Singing at the seaside
Talking with the fishermen
He made them deciples
Saving all sinners
Keep on pushing now
Tomorrow there's wisdom


Hoverin' by my suitcase, tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
Heavy rain fallin', seems I hear your voice callin' "It's all right."
A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia
It seems like it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
Neon signs a-flashin', taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
A distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night
A rainy night in Georgia, such a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and you just got to play the game
I find me a place in a box car, so I take my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest I hold your picture to my chest and I feel fine
But it's a rainy night in Georgia, baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia I
Feel it's rainin' all over the world, kinda lonely now And it's rainin' all over the
World
Oh, have you ever been lonely, people?
And you feel that it was rainin' all over this man's world
You're talking 'bout rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin',
Rainin', rainin' rainin', rainin', rainin'


Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away
And I know
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away
I wonder this time where she's gone?
I wonder if she's gone to stay?
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
And I know
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And everybody knows this house just ain't no home


Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Oooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time[Whistle]


When the night has come and the land, it is dark
And the moon is the only light that we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long as you stand, stand by me
If the sky, we look upon should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble into the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, and I won't shed a tear
Just as long, just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darlin', darlin', stand, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, my darlin', please stand by me
If the sky, we look upon should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble into the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long, just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darlin', darlin', stand, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, please stand by me
Whenever I'm in trouble won't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, stand by me, oh darlin', please stand by me

If you disrespect anybody that you run in to
How in the world do you think anybody's s'posed to respect you
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man with the bible in his hand
Just get out the way, and let the gentleman do his thing
You the kind of gentleman that want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy, it's a brand new day
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you're walking 'round think'n that the world owes you something cause
You're here you goin' out the world backwards like you did when you
Put your hand on your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution
Oh, you cuss around women and you don't even know their names and you
Dumb enough to think that'll make you a big ol man


If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live
Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
But I... Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy


I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is all right with me
You make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my whole life with you
Since, baby since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue
Let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Why, why some people break up
Then turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me (would you, baby)
Staying around you is all I see
(Here's what I want us to do)[Repeat to fade:]
Let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad


Say it's all right, say it's all right
Say it's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, it's all right
We're gonna move it slow
When the lights are low
When you move it slow, it sounds like more
And it's all right, it's all right
Now listen to the beat
You kinda pat your feet
'Cause you got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, it's all right
When you wake up early in the mornin'
Feelin' sad like so many of us do
Harm a little soul, make life your goal
And surely something gotta come to you
And say it's all right, say it's all right
It's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's all right, it's all right
Now everybody clap your hands
And give yourself a chance
'Cause you got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, it's all right
Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
And my woes got to go and my love she will know
From morning, noon and night
And she's gotta say that it's all right, say it's all right
Say it's all right, have a good time
'Cause it's alright, it's all right
Now come on and clap your hands
And give yourself a chance
'Cause you got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right, it's all right
Now come on and clap your hands
And give yourself a chance
You got soul and everybody knows
That it's all right


[Chorus:]
People get ready
There's a train coming
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all
If you'll just love the Lord
There ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind
Just to save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances grow thinner
There's no hiding place
Around the kingdon's throne[Chorus:]
People get ready
There's a train coming
Don't need no ticket
You just get on board
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board 'em
Don't need no ticket
You just thank the Lord


I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day.
When it's cold outside,
I've got the month of May.
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl. (My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl. (My girl)
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me.
I've got a sweeter songThan the birds in the trees.
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl. (My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl. (My girl)
Ooooh, Hoooo.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't need no money,
Fortune or fame.
I've got all the riches, baby,
One man can claim.
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl. (My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl. (My girl)
Talkin' bout my girl.
I've got sushine on cloudy day
With my girl.
I've even got the month of May
With my girl.


You do me wrong
But I'm still crazy about you
Stay away too long
And I can't do without you
Every chance you get
You seem to just hurt me more and more
But each hurt just makes my love go stronger
Stronger than before
I know flowers grow from rain
But how can love grow from pain
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be
You tell me lies
It should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you, baby
That I don't want to see
That the things you do and say
Are designed to make me blue
But it's a doggone shame my love for you
Makes all your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger?
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be
I cried so much just as like a child
That's lost it's toy
Baby, baby, you think these tears I cry
Are tears of joy
A child can cry so much
And then you do everything they say
No, no, no, like a child my tears don't help me
To get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears?
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be
I don't understand
Why you made me cry so much?
I don't understand
Why you lie so much?
And made me cry tears of pain
You made me cry for all that rain
I don't understand
Don't understand sometimes
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as it can be
Ain't that peculiar?
Peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?


I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know
What's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
When I go to my brother, my brother, my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up knockin' me
Right down on my, on the knees
And there been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think
I'm able to carry on
It's been a long
A long, long time coming
Well, I know, I know change gonna come
Oh, yes it will
It's been a long
It's been a long, long time coming
Well, I know, I know, I know change gonna come
Oh, yes it will


When the night has come and the land, it is dark
And the moon is the only light that we see

And the mountains should crumble into the sea

I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land
I've got a home built
In that yonder city, good Lord
And it's not, not made by hand
I got a mother
A sister and a father
Them gone on now, to the other shore
And I'm determined
To go and see them good Lord
And to live with them forever more
When I go down to the river of Jordan
Just to bathe my, my weary soul
If I can but touch
The hem of his garment good lord
Then I, I know you'll make me whole
And when he lay me down for the last time
With his hard hand restin' on my breast
I don't want none
Of that weeping and crying over me
Because you know that I've gone to rest
Yes, I'm a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this, this wearisome land
I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord
And it's not, not made by hand

Each day the sun
Come out to shine
Yes the stars and the moon
They just live on, just live on all the time
The wind it blows
As we listen and breathe and breathe
God's living air
You know the flowers grow, yeah
And they do not talk, Oh Lord
They do not spend
Spend or work at all
You know the birds they live
Live and, get their care
Surely there is, there is a God somewhere
Yes my heart tells me
Surely, surely, surely
There must be, must be a God somewhere


You know, the landlord rang my front door bell,
I let it ring for a long, long spell,
I went to the window, peaked through the bar,
Tell me what was on the old man’s mind.
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
Money, honey,
If you wanna stay here with me.
I scream and I scream and I’m so hard pressed
I call the woman that I love best.
I finally reached my baby by half past three
I said I like to do what you want with me.
She said

If you wanna get along with me.
She screamed and said “what’s wrong with you?”

Of two lovers that I knew well.

She don’t look at me but I love her just the same.
Ruby, ruby, how I want you,
Like a ghost I’m gonna haunt you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?
The next time I’ll see you

I’ve been in bed, I’m gonna get you
Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?

From nowhere, through a caravan,
Around the camp fire light,
A lovely woman in motion
But hair as dark as night.
Her eyes were like that of a candle doll
But it returns me with love.
She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman.
She danced around and round
To a guitar melody.
And from far her face was all a glow
How seen a chat in me.
Oh, how I’d like to hold her,
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear
I love you, gypsy woman,
I love you, gypsy woman.
All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun,
Everyone was in heaven.
I hate to see the lady go,
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her.
Gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, gypsy woman.
All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun,
Everyone was in heaven.
I hate to see the lady go,
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her.
Gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, gypsy woman.

Little bitty pretty one
Don’t wanna talk with me.
Lovely, lovely, lovely one,
I set apart on my knees.
Tell you a story about a long time ago
Little bitty pretty one
I bet you’re watching me go.
Little bitty pretty one
Don’t wanna talk with me.
Lovely, lovely, lovely one,
I set apart on my knees.


You don’t remember me, but I remember you.
It was not so long ago, you broke my heart in two.
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart,
Caused by you, you.
If we could start anew I wouldn’t hesitate
I’d gladly take you back and temper hand of fate.
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart,
Caused by you, you.
Longest, I will catch you,
And longest night of talk.
When you found the one you love
She filled your heart with joy.
Oh, we could start anew
I wouldn’t hesitate.
I could gladly take you back
And temper hand of fate.
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart,
Caused by you, you.
You don’t remember me,
I remember you
Like it was just yesterday,
I remember you
Cause you played me for a fool.


Oh, when the sun beats down and burns the tore up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your entire feet were fireproof.
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby it’s where I’ll be.
Under the boardwalk, I ever saw,
Under the boardwalk, to be having some fun,
Under the boardwalk, people walking above,
Under the boardwalk, to be falling in love,
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk.
And in the back you hear the tappy sound of the carousel
You can almost test the hot dogs and French fries they sell.
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby it’s where I’ll be.
Under the boardwalk, I ever saw,
Under the boardwalk, to be having some fun,
Under the boardwalk, people walking above,
Under the boardwalk, to be falling in love,
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk.

This magic moment, so different and so new,
Like any other until I kissed you.
And then it happened, it took me by surprise
I know you felt it, too, by the look in your eyes.
Sweeter than wine, softer than a summer night,
Everything I wanna have is when I pull you tight.
This magic moment, your ear close, close to mine
Will last forever, forever, till the end of the time.
Magic, magic, magic, magic.
Sweeter than wine, softer than a summer night,
Everything I wanna have is when I pull you tight.
This magic moment while your lips are close to mine
Will last forever, forever till the end of the time.
Magic, magic, magic, magic.
Magic, magic, magic, magic.
If you cry, my heart will break
Darling, that you moving I can take.
And if I saw a tear fall from your eye
Darling, don’t you know that I would die?
True love, true love, true love, true love.
If you cry, I don’t know what I’d do
Darling, I am so in love with you.
And if I heard that I had caused you pain
My tears will pour like the rain.
True love, true love, true love, true love.


Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
Sleep tight, my love, may tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.
Before you go, there’s just one thing I’d like to know,
Is your love still warm for me or has it gone cold?
If you should've wake in the still of the night,
Please, have no fear.
I’ll be there, you know I care
Please, give your love to me, dear, only.
Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
And sleep tight, my love, may tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.

Please, give your love to me, dear, only.
Goodnight, my love, pleasant dreams
And sleep tight, my love, may tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me.


The touch of your lips next to mine
Gets me excited and makes me feel fine
The touch of your hand and your sweet hello
Oh, the fire inside you when you're holding me close
Your love so warm and tender
Oh, the thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine
Make you mine
If you would leave
Lord, I surely, I surely would die
When you were ten minutes late
I started to cry
Oh, I've got it bad but it's all right
Oh, as long as you're here
Every, oh, every, every, every night
Your love, your love, your love, your love
So warm and tender, oh, and I know the thrill
I know the thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine
All that makes you mine
All that makes you mine
Never, never, never leave me
Oh, you'll always be mine


All you fear, is fear its self 
Check our your own back yard before you check out someone else 
Railroad track, in my neighbourhood 
Ain't no trains around that part just ain't no good 
Wanna know, what's going down, 
When the pimp on the corner looks like the sharpest cat in town 
Jungle rule, can't be no fool 
Might get caught by the hook of a crook no time for cool 
Look out jay, what you say, what you carrying brother 
I hope you're clean cause the man is mean, don't come another further 
We all know the answer, will come out in time 
I might even carry some of your load, right along with mine 
Thank you ma'am, mister please 
‘Cause I must be Hercules 
I must be Hercules 
Like a bird, on the wing 
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing 
I can feel the pressure, from every side 
If you not gonna help, don't hurt, just pass me by 
Oh, no 
Hercules 
I must be Hercules 
Jungle rule, can't be no fool 
Devil is on the loose, no coo 
Got your feet, in the sand 
Got to be down with the cats that around and still got the face the man 
Talk about me if you please but I must be Hercules 
Hercules 
I must be Hercules 
Duckin' rocks, catchin' stones 
Movin' how can I survive what's going on 
Beg, steal and borrow 
Somehow I've got to make it to tomorrow 
Can't depend, on no-one else 
Comin' up the hard way I've got to save myself 
Must be Hercules 
I must be Hercules 
Talk about me if you please 
I must be hercules


The sky may be starless,
The night may be moonless,
But deep in my heart there's a glow.
For deep in my heart
I know that you love me.
You love me because you told me so.
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart.
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write.
I memorize every line,
I kiss the name that you sign.
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart.
I memorize every line,
I kiss the name that you sign.
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart.


Ah ohh yaa
The holiday season puts a smile on my face
Even when I'm in a hurry going place to place
The bright lights sparkle and the snows fallin' down
I want the whole world to feel this peace that I've found
It starts with giving to all those in need
Feeding hungry children or the man on the street
Please don't forget what this season is about
Giving love to one another
Helping each other out
Please don't forget those who can't make their means
Just lend them a helping hand
And you'll both find joy and peace,  peace, peace
I see a man at a store ringing a bell
Saying thank you to those who are willing to help
If we all give a little then soon it all adds up
To the real meaning of Christmas the season of love
It starts with giving to all those in need
Give a coat to a child or a gift to a family
Please don't forget what this season is about
Giving love to one another
Helping each other out
Please don't forget those who can't make their means
Just lend them a helping hand
And you'll both find joy and peace, peace
Please don't forget what this season is about
Giving love to one another 
Helping each other out
Please don't forget those who can't make their means
Just lend them a helping hand
And you'll both find joy and peace, peace
Peace


You have a love that buys you pretty clothes
All the fine things heaven only knows that I wish I could
You have a love that dances and sings
Swings, says all the pretty little things that a playboy should
Well, he's got money, he's got charms
And when you're walkin' on and on
It hurts me so, but I just want you to know
That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And wish the best to you, push myself aside
And that's the greatest love, oh, that you?ll ever find
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You have a love, he's got the power
To entertain each and every hour of the day and night
You have a love, he's got the ways and means
To show you all the wild scenes when the lights are bright
Well, love should never be possessed
And this my darlin', don't forget
You?re free to go, oh, but I just want you to know
That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And I wish the best to you and I push myself aside
That's the greatest love, oh, that you?ll ever find
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Well, love should never be possessed
And this my darlin', don't forget
You're free to go, oh, but I just want you to know
That it's not easy, oh, heaven knows I tried
And I wish the best to you, push myself aside
That's the greatest love, oh, that you'll ever find
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh


It's a beautiful morning
looks like its going to be a beautiful day
but where is my baby?
Oh where is my baby
I breathe in a breath of fresh air
oh but again I say
where is my baby
Everything seems so right
Except for most important thing in my life
But where is my baby
Where can she be
Won't somebody please
Send my baby back to me
Boss told me in three days
I'd be up for a raise
Oh but where is my baby
Oh where is my baby
Going to look for a new car
Like that raven I saw
But where is my baby
What went wrong I couldn't say
I tried to please her
In every way
Oh but where is my baby
Where can she be
Won't somebody please
Send my baby back to me
A year has come and gone
Since I've been all alone
Lord and I still oh I still haven't seen my baby
I still hope and pray
That she'll return someday
But where is my baby
I bought a house I thought she would like
In case she'd ever decide to be my wife
And then the word came
You know by telephone
Said you don't want to see you baby
She's better off gone
Said while in a travel
A curiosity 
Led her into the wrong hands
Into a land of fantasy
Now she hangs out
Where those folks do
With the problems she'll never shake
Said your baby's through
No 
No, no I don't want to hear it


Give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
Cause I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life
Give me words to speak Don't let my spirit sleep...
Just Don't understand 
Just Don't understand 
Just Don't understand these lies I've been believing
Give me words to speak, don't let my spirit sleep


Great god of might, great god of wonders
giver of life, giver of grace
creator of everything before us
you had me in mind before the stars were in place
Your love surpasses all by far
We're praising You for all you are
The reason we're here and the reason we sing
is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king
we lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing
you are holy
The reason we're here and the reason we sing
is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king
we lift up our hands and we lift up our minds
and we pray that all we do would bring glory to you
father of love. father of mercy
what have I done that you would think about me?
you've taken my shame, you've taken my sorrow
replaced them with life and life abundantly
you can see inside my heart
you can see inside my mind
So strip away the things
that leave me deaf and blind


Son of a Man, Great I am, King of heaven,
son of god, you hold the measure of my days
Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb, You are worthy, I am not
Before Your throne I stand amazed
Every tongue confess and every knee will bow
To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now
Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless
Your name means more than i could know
You're so far above me, the way that you love me
goes further than any love could go
Wonderful Counselor, Root of David, morning star
you are the way, the truth, the life
lion of the tribe of judah, Mighty god is who you are
The only perfect sacrifice
In your name you took the blind man and you gave him back his sight
In your name you took the dead man and you brought him back to life
In your name you took this prisoner and you opened up the doors
And I will sing before your throne forever more


Our God is the God of gods
Our Lord is the Lord of kings
The revealer of secrets, of mysteries unknown
Let the people praise our God
His sovereign rule will last forever
His kingdom won't decline or fall
He does as He pleases both in Heaven and Earth
Who am I that I should question Him at all?
He lifts up kings and brings them low again
He shows us what is right from wrong
God of all time we give You thanks and praise
For you have made us wise and You have made us strong
Everything He does is right and all His ways are just
Those who walk in pride He is able to humble


I come to you, oh god, in the stillness of my heart
I need your healing and your voice in the stillness of my heart
Speak to me and show me who you are
rescue me with your unfailing love and mercy
speak to me and show me who you are
Hold me tightly in your arms and never let me go
I hear you calling out my name in the stillness of my heart
your grace is given me again, now I open my heart
I remember singing praises to your name every day with all my might
How I long to sing to you again


God of unending grace, I come to You on my face
I need to hear You speak to me, won't You make me new right now
God of omnipotent power, visit us in this hour
And may we leave here changed because we1ve met with You, God
You've been more wonderful to me than I could have ever imagined
You've shown more love than I could show in a thousand years
And although it seems at times like it all means nothing to me
You gotta know that I love You
You gotta know that I need You
God of wisdom and love, settle down from above
Give us all a taste of what Your Holy Spirit can do
Time and time again we've betrayed, but our debt's already been paid
And all that leaves me wanting is to live for you, God
When the world crashes down around me
I know You'll be there to pull me out from the rubble
When my enemy surrounds and I call on your name
You1ll be there to deliver me from my troubled soul
Rescue me from all my selfish ways
and thoughts and deeds and plans
Lead me in the everlasting way
and I will follow you there


Search my heart, search my mind
Search my soul
Make me clean, make me new
Make me whole
All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design
'Cause You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
You are my strength, You are my God
You are my King
You make me laugh, You make me dance
You make me sing
All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design
'Cause You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
Everything inside, everything outside
I give it all away
You never change but You rearrange
My heart more everyday
All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design
All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now, submit to Your design
'Cause You are the one
Who can make my life complete
You are the one
Who can give light to my feet
You are the one and only one
Who dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away for me
You dared to give it all away
You  gave it all away for me
You  gave it all away for me
Search my heart, search my mind
Search my soul


King of all the universe 
We love You and we come to You know
Asking for Your healing touch 
We need You this very hour
Would you help us comprehend what it means to worship You
'cause we're blinded by our circumstance
Heal our eyes today
May we know Your love; feel it course through our veins
Encircling our hearts and embracing our souls
We need Your love and grace to remain, to rearrange our hearts
And change the way we praise
Son of God who took my place 
We thank You and may we realize
You've made us righteous in His sight
You took our wrongs and made them right
We owe You all of our lives
Love me, Father, for I am Your son
(and I am Your daughter)


I am not skilled to understand
What God has willed what God Has planned
I only know at his right hand
Stands one who is my Savior
I take him at his word and deed
Christ died to save me this I read
And in my heart I find the need
Of him to be my Savior
That he would leave his place on high
And come for sinful man to die
You called it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior[x2:]
My Savior loves
My Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God he was
My God he is
My God he's always gonna be
Yes living, dying let me bring
My strength my Solace from the Spring
That he who lives to be my king
Once died to be my Savior
That he would leave his place on high
And come for sinful man to die
You called it strange, so once did I
Before I knew my Savior[x2:]
My Savior loves
My Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God he was
My God he is
My God he's always gonna be[Pause][x3:]
My Savior loves
My Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God he was
My God he is
My God he's always gonna be
My Savior lives
My Savior loves
My Savior lives
My Savior loves
My Savior lives


Everybody praise the Lord
Every nation applause His name
For great is His love toward us
The faithfulness of the Lord endures
The faithfulness of the Lord endures
Forever
Be at rest once more my soul
For the Lord has been good to you


In Your name You took the blind man
And You gave him back his sight
In Your name You took the dead man
And You brought him back to life
In Your name You took this prisoner
And You opened up the doors
And I will sing before
Your throne forever more


One day, I will leave this body 
And I will get a perfect one
That day I will see His glory 
Shinin' like the noonday sun
One day, I'll take a walk with Jesus
He might explain the mysteries of life
Some say, I just can't believe it 
But I know that one day
We'll gather at the Crystal Throne
All these years; we're finally home
I can actually see His face
And all I can do is say
Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
We lay our crowns before You 
Every heart and soul; adore You
The God of gods, Almighty One
One day, death will be abolished
And sin will have it's mastery no more
And I know, that we will be astonished
At all that our Creator has in store
One day, we will meet our Savior 
And He will give each one of us a stone
Engraved ,with our names upon it: 
Known by God alone
We'll gather at the Crystal Throne
All these years; we're finally home
I can actually see His face
I never thought I'd see the day
That we'd gather at the Crystal Throne
All these years; we're finally home
I can actually see His face
And all I can do is say
Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty
Who was and is and is to come
We lay our crowns before You 
Every heart and soul; adore You
The God of gods, Almighty One
King of Kings, God's only Son
Lords of Lords, salvation done.


My heart keeps beating even though I can't control it.
My lungs keep breathing I admit I don't know how.
Bring the flood or bring the fire in this lifetime
I'm ready for the altar or the plough
There are always days when I don't feel like singing
There are always days when I don't care at all
But I know the King of All Creation reigns completely
Over every moment great and small
Long live the One who gives us
Life and peace and hope for tomorrow
You've given everything we needed
From the palm of Your hand
I'll give my everything to the One
Who pledged to cancel My sorrow
All I have is Yours (Long Live the King)
Humbly we approach Your throne of Mercy
Aware that we're unworthy of Your Grace
(But) You have offered pardon and forgiveness
Grievances are gone without a trace
You restore our lives even though we don't deserve it
And You've given us a love that's not our own
You assemble all our broken, shattered pieces:
More beautiful than I had ever known
You Shall Reign Forever and Ever
You Shall Reign, You Shall Reign
Forever and Ever and Ever and Ever and


(Been) training all this time
I'm at the starting line
A marathon I'm gonna have to run
In such a way as if to win the prize
And I believe
Even though I can't see
All the athletes from days gone by
Are in the stadium surrounding me
And in the days
before the final phase
I sacrificed the things that held me down
And concentratedly I fixed my gaze.
A shot resounds
My heart begins to pound
And I begin to know what it's like
To run as if I had nobody around
And I feel like I never felt before
I ran through the open door
And I feel like I never felt before
And it seems You're aware of so much more
Than I gave You credit for
And I feel like I never felt before
Climbing high
I can almost touch the sky
But every time I'm halfway there
I think I'll never reach the top alive
But I'm aware
I'm safely in Your care
And with Your help I'll never face a day
That I am unable to bear
You taught me to crawl
You taught be to stand
You taught me run one step at a time
and watch out for the quicksand
You taught me to live
You taught me to die
You taught me to spread My wings and how to fly


Separated from night
You spoke and then there was light
They point to You
Divided water from land
Bowing to Your command
They point to You
The sun that's blazing at noon
And every phase of the moon
They point to You.
A baby's cry and the way
A sunset closes the day
They point to You.
For You're the only One worth praising
More radiant than earth and sky
And everyday that I survey Your creation
I see why I see why
God of everything I see,
Come create again in me
You were yesterday
and You will always be
So take each breath that I breathe
And be the life that I bleed
Create again in me
The storm that's raging at sea
The little child on her knees
They point to You
Your grace that's poured out on me
The sacrifice on a tree
They point to You
Your Word vaults across the sky
From sunrise to sunset
Melting the ice, scorching the desert
Warm our hearts to faith
(create again in me)


I was lonely, You came waltzing over to me
And Your eyes they saw right through me
And You heard each one of my cries for help
And You came to rescue me
I was broken, every prayer that I had spoken
Reached Your ears and all my tears weren't cried in vain
You carried all my pain
And put me back together again
You watch over me in the darkest valleys
You watch over me when the night seems long
You help me to see the way before me
You watch over me, you watch over me
Always faithful to be leading, at this moment
Interceding for Your children
Though I've wandered astray from Your infinite ways
You've never left me alone
Take my frozen heart, awaken me
Never once have You forsaken me
Even though I walk through this shadow of death
You will guide and defend me
You'll guard and protect me
Even though I walk through this shadow of death
You will lead me home


Give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
Cause I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life
Give me words to speak Don't let my spirit sleep...
Just Don't understand 
Just Don't understand 
Just Don't understand these lies I've been believing
Give me words to speak, don't let my spirit sleep


Before the break of dawn
My heart cries out to You
Where I'm surrounded by my night
Here all my weaknesses will wait upon Your mercy
The hope of dawn from black to white
From black to white
I love You more than life itself
Lord, You are so good to me
I need You more with every breath
So won't You breathe some life in me
Won't You breathe some life in me
Awakening the dawn, with all my heart
I sing to You
You are the reaSon that I live
Under me, over, all around I know You're with me
Never condemning: You forgive
No matter where I go
No matter where I stand
Your Spirit always speaks to me
And tells me whose I am
With every breath I take
And every choice I make
My heart will always sing to You


At the name of Jesus every knee will bow
And every tongue confess Him the King of Glory now
It's the Father's pleasure that we should call Him Lord
ho from the beginning was the mighty Word
Glory to the Lord on high
Glory to the Son who came to earth to die
Glory to the Spirit who lifts the name on high:
The Name of Jesus, The Name of Jesus
At His voice creation sprang at once to sight
All the angel faces and all the host of light
Thrones and dominations, stars upon their way
All the heavenly order, in their great array
They sang
In Your hearts enthrone Him; there let Him subdue
All that is not holy, all that is not true
Crown Him as Your Captain, in temptation's hour
Let His will enthrall You, in its light and power.


When I am tired You bring me comfort
(I will wait; I will wait for You)
When I am weak You give me strength
(I will wait; I will wait for You)
When I can't walk You give me wings like an eagle
(I will wait; I will wait for You)
When I'm alone You bring me peace
(I will wait)
I will wait for Your mercy
I will wait for Your plan to unfold
I will wait for Your mercies are new every morning
When I am wounded You heal my broken bones
(I will wait; I will wait for You)
And when I sing You fill my heart with joy
(I will wait; I will wait for You)
And when I fear the unknown You give me peace
(I will wait; I will wait for You)
And when I call, You always answer me
(I will wait)
We wait for You like watchmen wait for morning
We wait for You like creation waits for spring
We wait for You knowing sometimes without warning
You reveal Your plan in ways that maybe we don't understand


I would leave My world behind
Give up everything that's mine
If I could know you
I would leave behind My home
Enter your world all alone
If I could find you
It doesn't matter if you run away
It doesn't matter if you hide
I would leave my world far behind
This love inside of Me; it's never gonna die
And I don't care how far away you roam
No I don't care how far away you roam
I'll come running out with open arms to welcome you back home
I'll come running out with open arms to welcome you back home
I would love to see our name
Engraved upon a picture frame
On my mantle
I would love to see your face
Every morning as you wake up
To see Me
I just wish that I could talk to you
Because I love you more than life


I was lost and I was blind
I was begging for a sign
that someone
Somewhere heard me
As You whispered in the wind
And You shouted in the waves
That You heard me
That You loved me
And I could finally
Stop resisting
You're Everything I ever wanted
And never knew I needed
You're Everywhere I ever go
I can't hide from Your Love anymore
I begin to drop my guard
Faithful as the Morning Star
You show me tender mercy
I'm surrounded by Your beauty
I get lost in Heaven's
Symphony
It never changes
Never ending
Unrelenting
Why would I want to?
I don't want to


Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
To receive power, wealth and wisdom and thanks
And honor and glory and praise
Blessing and Honor Glory and Power
Let all I do give praise to You
Let all I sing be to honor You My King


Can You take me by the hand?
Can You use me as I am?
Break me into who You want me to be
When the time is finally right
Will You open up my eyes
And show me everything You want me to see?
This life is not my own
To God alone be the glory
To God alone be the praise
Everything I say and do
Let it be all for You
The glory is Yours alone
Yours alone
Take the offering I bring
You want more than what I sing
Can I give You every part of me?
Turn these pennies into gold
Take this life I call my own
Until I'm running after Your heart
I'm needing to let go
To God alone be the glory
To God alone be the praise
Everything I say and do
Let it be all for You
The glory is Yours alone
We will rise and we will fall
But You remain after all
You're glorious and beautiful
You're beautiful
To God alone be the glory
To God alone be the praise
Everything I say and do
Let it be all for You
The glory is Yours alone
The glory is Yours alone
Yours alone
Yours alone


The edge of a cliff, the dead end signs
That we've been ignoring all this time
All our mistakes and crossing lines
That sinking feeling that's not far behind
We're less than more
We're falling short
No matter how we try
There's nothing we can do
Nothing we can do
Father, we need You
To come and save us
If we could see behind the veil
Just a glimpse of how
You love us when we fail
Maybe we would finally see
Your mercy never ends
There's nothing we can do
Nothing we can do
Father, we need You
To come and save us
There's nothing we can do
Nothing we can do
Father, we need You
To come and save us
It's all been done
It's all been done
You have come
All for love
There's nothing we can do
Nothing we can do
Father, we need You
To come and save us
There's nothing we can do
Nothing we can do
Father, we need You
To come and save us
Father, we need You
To come and save us
Father, we need You
To come and save us
To come and save us


Long before the earth
Before there was light
Lord You were
Endless are You God
No time can contain all You are
There's no other God before You
There is no one to replace You
You are forevermore
And there's no other God I call to
You are the One I cling to
You are forevermore
Faithful are You God
You never change
Lord You are
Only You are God
Forever You reign above it all
There's no other God before You
There is no one to replace You
You are forevermore
And there's no other God I call to
You are the One that I cling to
You are forevermore
There's no other
No one Greater
There is none like You
There's no other
No one Greater
There is none like You
There's no other God before You
There is no one to replace you
You are forevermore
And there's no other God I call to
You are the one that I cling to
You are forevermore
There's no other God before You
There is no one to replace you
You are forevermore
And there's no other God I call to
You are the one that I cling to
You are forevermore
You are forevermore


I tried to run
I tried to fight You, I'm done
I'm giving up
I've learned to trust You, Your love
Now I'm singing
Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me?
I've been here over and over again here on my knees
I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be
When You take over, take over, can You take over me?
I tried before
To let go and I just hold on more
Amazing Lord
I need the strength to let go and be Yours
So now I'm singing
Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me?
I've been here over and over again here on my knees
I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be
When You take over, take over, can You take over me?
I surrender all I have
And I surrender all I am
As I remember
What You've done to set me free
I just wanna sing
Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me?
I've been here over and over again here on my knees
I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be
When You take over, take over, can You take over me?
Can You take over, take over? Can You take over me?
I've been here over and over again here on my knees
I'm only closer and closer to where I wanna be
When You take over, take over, can You take over me?
Take over me
Take over me


When there's no breath in my lungs to scream
And there's no strength left inside of me
When there's no light that my eyes can see
I will say Your name, I will say Your name
And stars will fall like rain
All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake
Every mountain will be moved and cast away
At the mention of Your name
At the mention of Your name
When hope is a long lost friend
And the broken that was meant to bend
Lift the wounds that were never mend
I will say Your name, I will say Your name
And stars will fall like rain
All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake
Every mountain will be moved and cast away
At the mention of Your name, oh
At the mention of Your name, oh
Jesus, I cry, Jesus
Jesus, I cry, Jesus
And stars will fall like rain
All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake
Every mountain will be moved and cast away
At the mention of Your name, oh
And stars will fall like rain
All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake
Every mountain will be moved and cast away
At the mention of Your name
At the mention of Your name
At the mention of Your name


When you're broken, when you're weak
When you turn the other cheek
When you cannot speak of the bitter sweet, the bitter sweetness
When the floor gives out beneath
And everything that you believe cannot bring you peace
You're broken inside, broken in pieces
You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you
Rest in the arms of the One who knows you
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go
You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you
Rest in the arms of the One who loves you
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go
When the waters starts to rise and you've lost the will to fight
When you're losing light
Just close your eyes, close your eyes now
You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you
Rest in the arms of the One who knows you
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go
You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you
Rest in the arms of the One who loves you
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go
Have no fear I'll be here
You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you
Rest in the arms of the One who knows you
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go
You can rest in the arms of the One who holds you
Rest in the arms of the One who loves you
Rest in the arms of the One who won't let go


Take my life, take it all
I lay it at Your throne
I am rich, satisfied
When I am Yours alone
I have learned to live to lose
I have found my home in You
I count it all as lose, it's true
'Cause I have learned to live to lose
Precious One, crucified
Died to set me free
I hold nothing back from You
Who gave it all for me
I have learned to live to lose
I have found my home in You
I count it all as lose, it's true
'Cause I have learned to live to lose
Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me
Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me
Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me
Jesus You're the One, You're the only One for me
I have learned to live to lose
I have found my home in You
I count it all as lose, it's true
I have learned to live
Yes, I have learned to live to lose
I have learned to live to lose


I hate to be the one to break the news
To let you down but I can't lie to you
There's things about the world I wish weren't true
I guess by now, you must have had a clue
It seems you're growing up fast
I tried my best to push back
Would you believe me if I told you
There's no such thing as Peter Pan
No such place as Never Never Land
I wish we all could have
Those tiny magic wings
But we live in a world with wars
It's not like it was before
We won't find our happy ever after here
There's no such thing
I've dreaded this talk for so long
I knew someday you'd wonder what went wrong
We get to be the story of it all
For the Glory of it all and so we move along
This is not where it ends
It's just where it begins
Would you believe me if I told you
There's no such thing as Peter Pan
No such place as Never Never Land
I wish we all could have
Those tiny magic wings
But we live in a world with wars
It's not like it was before
We won't find our happy ever after here
It's not where we belong and if it's feeling wrong
Oh, you must stay strong
'Cause it was here that I first saw your face
Every night I pray that you'd believe the same
There's no such thing as Peter Pan
No such place as Never Never Land
I wish we all could have
Those tiny magic wings
But we live in a world with wars
It's not like it was before
We won't find our happy ever after here
There's no such thing
There's no such thing
I hate to be the one to break the news
To let you down but I can't lie to you


I've never felt so undeserving
Then when You called out for me
I've never been more unworthy
When You reached down for me
I'm lifting hands, stained and dirty
To touch my Savior's face
And I know now, I am touching grace
You see everything I do
But still You love me
You hear everything that I say
But still You want me
You know all my darkest secrets
That I try so hard to hide
You know everything I am
But still You love me, still You love me
Amazing love, how can it be
That You would die for me
Amazing grace, oh, the mystery
My blinded eyes now see
When I fall, when I stumble
I struggle to my feet
Just to find grace is lifting me
You see everything I do
But still You love me
You hear everything that I say
But still You want me
You know all my darkest secrets
That I try so hard to hide
You know everything I am
But still You love me
There's nothing I can say
To make You turn away
There's nowhere I can go
You're never far away
You see everything I do
But still You love me
You hear everything I say
But still You want me
You see everything I do
But still You love me
You hear everything that I say
But still You want me
You know all my darkest secrets
That I try so hard to hide
You know everything I am
But still You love me, still You love me
Still You love me


Mercy, in Your tender mercy
Look on me, look on me
Frailty, even in my frailty
Welcome me, welcome me
Father this my invocation
That You would come and meet me once again
Breathe in me, breath of God
Mend in me this wounded heart
That I may know You've made Your peace with me
Breathe in me
Burden, take away this burden
Set me free, set me free
Calling, I heard You calling
Out for me, You shout for me
Father this my invocation
That You would come and meet me once again
And I know that You will hear my pleading
And You will find me ever once again
Breathe in me, breath of God
Mend in me this wounded heart
That I may know You've made Your peace with me
Breathe in me
Empty, empty
Fill me, Father fill me
Empty, I am empty
Won't You fill me once again?
Breathe in me, breath of God
Mend in me this wounded heart
That I may know You've made Your peace
That I may know You've made Your peace
That I may know You've made Your peace with me
Breathe in me
Grateful, I'm forever grateful


Take my ashes, take my dirt and clay
Take my pride and strip it all away
Take my mourning, take my doubt and fear
Say the words I long to hear
Though your sins were as scarlet
They will be as white as snow
Though they were red, red as crimson
They will be like wool
When everything is beautiful
Everything I tried too hide
All the games I've been playing
Every secret, every lie
All the shame I've been claiming
Come and whisper in my ear
And say the words I long to hear
Though your sins were as scarlet
They will be as white as snow
Though they were red, red as crimson
They will be like wool
When everything is beautiful
I'm alive with a hope of a brand new day
I'm alive with the hope of a brand new day
Though your sins were as scarlet
They've become as white as snow
Though they were red, red as crimson
They've become like wool
Though your sins were as scarlet
They've become as white as snow
Though they were red, red as crimson
They've become like wool
And everything is beautiful
Everything is beautiful


Lord, bring me home again
I'm no longer able
To bare the bitter winds
Or the heavy rains
I've long been settled
Lord, without comfort
Just a man on an earthly throne
Headed for the grave
Carry me home
Sweet Jesus, lift me
Until I've flown
The shadow of shame
Your love alone
Lord Jesus mends me
Lift me up
Oh Lord, carry me home
Lord, I've been branded
A loyal sinner
Seems like forever
Since I said Your name
I'm just a pilgrim
Still afraid of dying
But the sea is shinning brightly
With Your grace
Carry me home
Sweet Jesus, lift me
Until I've flown
The shadow of shame
Your love alone
Lord Jesus mends me
Lift me up
Oh Lord, carry me home
Carry me home
Sweet Jesus, lift me
Until I've flown
The shadow of shame
Your love alone
Lord Jesus mends me
Lift me up
Oh Lord, carry me home
Carry me home
Sweet Jesus, lift me
Until I've flown
The shadow of shame
Your love alone
Lord Jesus mends me
Lift me up
Oh Lord, carry me home
Lift me up
Oh Lord, carry me home


All praise to You Eternal Lord,
Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood;
You chose a manger for Your throne,
While worlds on worlds are Yours alone.
Once did the skies before You bow;
A virgin's arms cradle You now,
and angels, who in You rejoice,
Now listen for Your infant voice.
They sing glory in the highest
there is no other name by which we can be saved
(Hallelujah)
Glory in the highest
heaven and earth forever will proclaim
that God has come to earth
Oh little Child, You are our Guest,
That weary ones in You may rest;
Forlorn and lowly is Your birth;
That we may rise to Heaven from earth.
Singing glory in the highest
there is no other name by which we can be saved
(Hallelujah)
Glory in the highest
heaven and earth forever will proclaim
that God has come to earth
All this for us Your love hath done;
By this to You our love is won;
For this we tune our cheerful lays,
And shout our thanks in ceaseless praise.
We sing glory in the highest
there is no other name by which we can be saved
(Hallelujah)
Glory in the highest
heaven and earth forever will proclaim
that God has come to earth
that God has come to earth
God has come to earth
God has come to earth


O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of Hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel


Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth


You are the Christ
Anointed One
Light of the world
God’s only Son
In the beginning was the Word
Emmanuel has come to live with us
Truly this Man is the Son
The Son of God
Who takes away the sins of the world
This Man is the Lamb
The Lamb of God
Who takes away the sins of the world
This is what we believe
You are the Way
The Truth and the Life
You came to change
Our wrongs to right
In the beginning was the Word
And we must sing of what we've seen and heard
We believe that You are God
Born to set Your people free
Became the final sacrifice
Conquered death to bring us life
This is what we believe


I meet with You and my soul sings out
As your word throws doubt far away
I sing to You and my heart cries
"Holy! Hallelujah, Father, You're near!"
My hope is in You, Lord
All the day long, I won't be shaken by drought or storm
A peace that passes understanding is my song
And I sing my hope is in You, Lord
I wait for You and my soul finds rest
In my selfishness, You show me grace
I worship You and my heart cries "Glory
Hallelujah, Father, You're here!"
My hope is in You, Lord
All the day long I won't be shaken by drought or storm
A peace that passes understanding is my song
And I sing my hope is in You, Lord
I will wait on You
You are my refuge
I will wait on You
You are my refuge
My hope is in You, Lord, all the day long
I won't be shaken by drought or storm
My hope is in You, Lord
All the day long I won't be shaken by drought or storm

I will sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love for me
On the cruel cross He suffered
From the curse to set me free
I will tell the wondrous story
How my lost estate He saved
In His boundless love and mercy
He the ransom freely gave
I will sing
Sing of my Redeemer
With His blood
He has purchased me
On the Cross
Jesus sealed my pardon
He paid the debt and set me free
I will praise my dear Redeemer
His triumphant power I'll tell
Of the victory He gives us
Over sin and death and hell
I will sing of my Redeemer
His Relentless love for me
He from death to life has brought us
Son of God with Him to be
We will praise the Lamb for sinners slain
For His blood can wash away our stain
Singing glory, glory to His name
For His blood can wash away…


There is nothing in this world
That means as much to me
Than the fact that You came looking
In my hour of desperate need
I was lost but then You found me
I was blind but now I see
Who You are
Who You are
Giver of hope when all is hopeless
When i was picking up the scraps
Lord, You never stop pursuing
Never give up when dreams collapse
We have been touched by grace amazing
You gave it all to buy us back
It's who You are
Who You are
You are the author of salvation
Perfecter of our faith
The God of restoration
Our sins have been erased
There is now no more condemnation
You’ve covered us with grace
There has never been a greater love
There has never been a greater love
Never a gift has been so lovely
Never a love has been so pure
I can't imagine ever finding
Somebody else who loves us more
Even though we cannot repay You
We'll give our lives in the pursuit
Of who You are
Who You are
Jesus, You're so wonderful
Oh how wonderful
You are


By the power of Jesus name
Strongholds break, strongholds break
He's our fortress and our strength
God, we will trust in You
Heaven moves and darkness quakes
When we pray, when we pray
He is strong and He will save
God, we will trust in You
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world
There is no power strong enough to fear
He is our firm foundation
And our hope has been secured
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world
Here and now we will proclaim it
Our God saves, our God saves
Standing firm, we shout our praises
God, we will trust in You
Pressing on to take the promise
We will praise, we will praise
Nothing here can ever harm us
God we will trust in you
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world
There is no power strong enough to fear
He is our firm foundation
And our hope has been secured
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world
Take heart our God
Has overcome the world
Take heart our God
Has overcome the world
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world
There is no power strong enough to fear
He is our firm foundation
And our hope has been secured
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world
Greater is He that lives in us
Than he that is in the world


That you would leave Your throne
And make this world Your home
Forsaking majesty
Embracing mundane
And all of its shame
You walked our dusty streets
Healing a world in need
You looked into the eyes
Of sinners like me
Setting us free
What wondrous love is this
What wondrous love is this
That You would lay aside Your glory for my soul
What wondrous love is this
What wondrous love is this
That You would lay down Your life for my soul
Enduring agony
You bore the cross for me
Betrayed by those You love
You took all our blame
Bearing our pain
They nailed Your feet
They nailed Your hands
You are the God
Who understands
You know rejection
Loss and grief
You loved a world
That nailed You to a tree


We are more than conquerors
We don't have to be afraid
Nothing is as powerful
As His love
Oh, the way He gave His Son
To give life to everyone
Not a thing can separate us
From His love
It's the life and the hope that He brings
His forgiveness that leads us to sing
We are free to love
Like our God has loved
We are free to give like He gave
We are free from sin
We are free to begin
To forgive as He forgave
We are free
We are living evidence
He restores our innocence
Jesus stands in our defense
All for love
It's the grace and the peace that He brings
His forgiveness that leads us to sing
We are free to love
Like our God has loved
We are free to give like He gave
We are free from sin
We are free to begin
To forgive as He forgave
We are free, we are free
Nothing can separate us
Nothing can separate us, Lord
Nothing can ever take us from You
Nothing can separate us
Nothing can separate us, Lord
Nothing can ever take us from You
From You
We are free to love
Like our God has loved
We are free to give like He gave
Oh, we are free from sin
We are free to begin
To forgive as He forgave
We are free, we are free, oh yeah

That anybody who believes in Him will have
Everlasting life

Every man and woman
Every boy and girl

Sing it out, shout it loud
Cover all the earth
Let the sound of the saints
Everywhere be heard
Praise the God who has come
To cure every broken heart.
He is lord over all
His reign will never end
Through the fire and the flood
He draws his children in
He's the light of the world
Brighter than the brightest star.[Chorus:]
The god of brilliant lights
Is shining down over us
Breaking through the darkness
Covering all the earth
Oooh, his love is like an ocean
Oooh, forever overflowing

And lay your troubles down
At the feet of the one whose mercy will abound
He's not afraid of our filth
He will never turn away[Chorus:]

Is shining down over us
Breaking through the darkness
Covering all the earth
Oooh, his love is like an ocean
Oooh, forever overflowing

My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
but wholly trust in Jesus' name[Chorus:]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
Weak made strong, in the Savior's love
Through the storm
He is Lord, Lord of All
When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil[Chorus]
He is Lord, Lord of all[Chorus 2x]
Then He shall come with trumpets sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
faultless, stand before the throne


Let us hear the sound of angels
Sing holy, holy, holy is the Lord
Let us see the saints and elders
Gathering in worhip 'round Your throne
There's only one desire
In the heart of Your redeemed
To step deeper in the place
Where earth and heaven meet
With the sound like rushing waters
We sing blessing honor and praise
With one voice that rolls like thunder
Every tongue will now proclaim
Our God reigns!
Our God reigns!
Oh we long to hear the nations
Declaring You are Lord of everything
Every king and every ruler
Throwing down their crowns at Your feet
All majesty and power
On the earth and above
Be to the only God
Who was and is and is to come
With the sound like rushing waters
We sing blessing honor and praise
With one voice that rolles like thunder
Every tongue will now proclaim
Our God reigns!

The day is dark and I can't see
The path I'm on or what's in front of me
But I will stand on this I know
You will never let me go
For the one who holds tomorrow
Holds me in His hand
And I will not fear the future
I'll trust the Great I Am

They've been washed as white as snow

Reigning on His throne
For the One who holds me in His hand

And the sky may even fall

Every heart that is afraid
You hear our desperate call
You are strong enough to save

You hold it all
You hold it all
For the one who holds tomorrow
Holds me in His hand
And I will not fear the future

No more sadness now, nor fasting,
Now we put our grief away;
God came down, the Everlasting,
Taking human flesh to-day.
God came down on earth a stranger,
Working out His mighty plan;
God was cradled in a manger,
Very God and very man.
There were shepherds once abiding,
In the field to watch by night.
And they saw the clouds dividing;
And the sky above was bright.
And a glory shone around them,
On the grass as they wore laid;
And a holy Angel found them,
And their hearts were sore afraid.
"Fear ye not," he said, "for cheerful
Are the tidings that I bring,
Unto you, so weak and fearful,
Christ is born, the Lord and King"
As the Angel told the story
Of the Saviour's lowly birth,
Multitudes were singing "Glory
Be to God, and peace on earth."
Angel choir sing Hallelujah
God's redeeming love proclaim
Let Thy Church, in every nation,
Sing the glory of Thy name.
Angel choir sing Hallelujah
God's redeeming love proclaim
Let Thy Church, in every nation,
Sing the glory of Thy name.
Sing the glory of Thy name.


All praise to You Eternal Lord,
Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood;
You chose a manger for Your throne,
While worlds on worlds are Yours alone.
Once did the skies before You bow;
A virgin's arms cradle You now,
and angels, who in You rejoice,
Now listen for Your infant voice.
They sing glory in the highest
For there is no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and earth forever will proclaim
That God has come to earth
Oh little Child, You are our Guest,
That weary ones in You may rest;
Forlorn and lowly is Your birth;
That we may rise to Heaven from earth.
They sing glory in the highest
For there is no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and earth forever will proclaim
That God has come to earth
Oh come let us adore Him [x4]
Glory in the highest
For there is no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
Heaven and earth forever will proclaim
Glory in the highest
For there is no other name by which we can be saved
Glory in the highest
And Heaven and earth forever will proclaim
For there is no other name by which we can be saved
And Heaven and earth forever will proclaim
That God has come to earth
That God has come to earth
God has come to earth
God has come to earth

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And angel sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
O little town of Bethlehem
O little town of Bethlehem
O little town of Bethlehem

So rejoice, O rejoice
Hallelujah Christ has come
So rejoice, lift your voice
Sing Emmanuel with us
O rejoice
Good Christian men rejoice
With heart and soul and voice
Now ye hear of endless bliss

And man is blessed forever more

So rejoice, lift your voice

Over silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light.
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,

I swore Id never love again a promise I'd keep till the end
But then you made a liar out of me 
But even a man of his words can't talk his way out of the hurt
When everything reminds him of his old used to be
But you made me forget about
What's her name I can't remember a thing because my mind is always on you 
I just draw a blank every time I try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two 
You made me forget about, what's her name
Girl I was down and out without a shadow of a doubt
Until you shined your love light on me
I lost my faith in love my soul had given up 
It took a miracle to make me believe
But you made me forget about
What's her name I can't remember a thing because my mind is always on you 
I just draw a blank every time I try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two 
You made me forget about 
What's her name I can't remember a thing because my mind is always on you 
I just draw a blank every time I try to think about the girl who tore my heart in two 
You made me forget about, what's her name


Growing up in a little town where there's not a lot to do
No matter where you go troubles bound to run into you
There was only one water hole this side of the county line
The boys and me would hang our clothes on the no trespassing sign[Chorus:]
We'd go swimming swinging from the tire in the tree
And we'd go fishing but we never caught anything
There was a chance we might get caught but we always got off scot-free
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Well the older the old man got the meaner he seemed to be
I could tell when our eyes met he didn't care to much for me
I remember on friday nights me and my girl would wait up late
When he'd turn off his front porch light we'd hop on over the gate[Chorus]
We'd go kissing underneath the cottonwood trees
And we'd go wishing on every star that we could see
There was a chance we might get caught but we always got off scot-free
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Not long ago I went back home for the labor day weekend
As I walked out of the store old man walker came walking in
He said I used to watch you one by one sneak under my gate
But I'd let ya'll play till your momma's said it was getting late
I'd come out a hollerin' and you boys would scatter and run
If you'd of known I was a teddy bear you wouldn't of had half the fun
I said you ol' son of a gun for all these years I thought you hated me
He said boy if that was true would I have hung a tire swing in the tree[Chorus]
Hearing y'all laughing it really put a smile on my face
Seeing y'all splashing really brightened up this place
There was a chance you might get caught but you always got off scot-free
Trespassing on old man walker's propertypacked my bags and said my good-byes early that sunday evening
I drove down the old man's dirt road just as I was leaving
Out there in that water hole were little boys like I used to be
Trespassing on old man walker's property
Trespassing on old man walker's property


While he's out running around with the boys at the bar downtown
His sweetheart sits at home all alone and she's waiting by the telephone
But he'll spend his quarter somewhere else
Well she's done what a good girl should but she's done all she could
So she packs her bags up for the next plain going home and he's crying by the telephone
But she'll spend her quarter somewhere else[CHORUS:]
And just a call to tell her that you love her
That is all she really ever wanted to hear
And it ain't asking much to tell her that you miss her
Just a call and that's all and she'd still be here
He spends a lot of time on the road breaking even with the rodeo
He knows he should call her but he's barely got enough and making ends meet is tough 
So he'll spend his quarter somewhere else[CHORUS][Instrumental Break][CHORUS]
She loves a guitar man who gave his heart to a five-piece band
He sings love songs underneath the neon lights while she alone tonight
Dreaming someday he'll live the songs he sings
Dreaming someday I'll live the songs I sing


If it was just another night like so many nights before
Just another dance, another time around the floor
Just another heart, you'd break and leave behind
Tell me why you're still awake and that girl is still on your mind
Cause she's not just another pretty face
This time you're in it for more than just the chase
Your hearts against the wall, you thought you seen em all
But she's not just another pretty face 
You thought your heart was ten feet tall and bullet proof
Till a girl only five foot three shot you with the cold hard truth 
All your friends might say, you're way in over your head
But deep down their just jealous it's not them instead 
You've gone hungry, saving for that diamond ring I never thought
You'd see the day
You'd get down on a knee
Cause she's not just another pretty face
This time you're in it for more than just the chase
Your hearts against the wall, you thought you seen em all
But she's not just another pretty face


I've never won a bear throwing a ball at the tri-state fair
I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
You were laughing at me and looking mighty dandy
Licking your lips and your cotton candy
I fell in love with you right then and there
When I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
Time stood still as we rode the Ferris wheel
There I was on top of the world
I said that I've been known to be accident-prone
So I asked you if I could hold your hand
That night I stole a kiss on the tunnel of love
And to this very day I still can't get enough
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
My hearts a tilt a whirl since I gave it to you girl
I don't want this ride to ever end
Corn dogs and barbecue a frosted funnel cake and you
All made that night to good to be true
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair
I've never won a bear throwing a ball at the tri-state fair
I still can't hit the broad side of a barn
I've never won a thing till I gave you a diamond ring
Now I'm the luckiest man in the world
I fell in love with you right then and there when I saw you at the Amarillo Fair


His mother begged him to be a cattleman
But he chose to wear the star his daddy wore
God blessed him with a sharp eye and a quick hand
Quicker than the man who shot his daddy to the floor
Still she prayed and she pleaded
But ranch work lacked the vengeance he needed
He was cursed on his daddy's dying day
When a shot to the back laid him in six feet in a grave[Chorus:]
And he wears a star on his vest
The only thing between a bullet and the heart in his chest
He'll be a ranger till he takes his last draw
He was born with the strong arm of the law
He wore a colt 45 on his hip
One notch short on the ivory grip
Searching for the outlaw that broke his momma's heart
Riding through the badlands from daylight to dark
In a dirty back water border town
Where the outlaw thought he could not be found
He looked like he'd seen a ghost when he saw the ranger's face
A legacy to the lawman he sent to his resting-place[Chorus]
The outlaw had no place to run
So he turned to the trigger on his gun
As the smoke cleared blood stained the dusty street
The outlaw lay dying at the ranger's feet
He sat in the saddle and shook his head
His gun still hot and his father still dead
As the sun set on the day he'd waited so long for
He saw justice belongs to the law but vengeance is the lord's


She left in a hurry, she wears she'll be back, but I'm kinda worried
Cause I can hear nashville calling her name
I wished her good luck, through the window of a pickup truck
She kissed me goodbye and then she drove away
Cause shes chasin her dreams and shes breakin mine
Shes takin heaven with her leavin nothin but hell behind
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But ill be right here where she left me
On the losing end
That old pickup made up of rust, left me standin in a cloud of dust
And when it settled, it couldn't have been any clearer
I was on the wrong end of the tracks and she wasn't lookin back
Not even a second glance, in her rear-view mirror
Cause shes chasin her dreams and shes breakin mine
Shes takin heaven with her leavin nothin but hell behind
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But ill be right here where she left me
Theres no future in this jukebox town
Singin her songs to me
So she took my heart with her guitar
And drove off to tennessee
Cause shes chasin her dreams and shes breakin mine
Shes takin heaven with her leavin nothin but hell behind
And I don't know if she'll be back again
But ill be right here where she left me


You're the devil's daughter in disguise*
So don't try to hide the fire in your eyes
You must be stupid cause you just don't have a clue
Even hell frozen over is warmer than my love for you[Chorus:]
When all those Aggies move to Austin
And Beaumont is covered in snow
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
Darlin' then you can come back home
You sure can shake your little round behind
But your hour glass figure won't buy my time
You know how to work it Lord knows it's worked before
This time you leave your butt will have the imprint of the front door [Chorus]
When Fort Worth is east of Dallas
And Texans forget the Alamo
When Lubbock opens up a ski resort
And the Brazos is straighter than an arrow[Chorus:]
When all those Aggies move to Austin
And Beaumont is covered in snow
When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
Darlin' then you can come back home
But don't hold your breath


In every little town from Dalhart to Laredo
There's a corner cafe' with an open sign in the window
As soon as you walk in a waitress greets you with a grin
And says make yourself feel right at home
Old men sit at a booth telling tall tales and stretching the truth
Bragging how bad the good ol' days used to be
They're all too tired to plow besides their tractors are rusted now
So they order hot apple pie with a cup of coffee[CHORUS:]
Some things will never change
After all these years the menu is still the same
Serving that sweet ice tea with a touch of southern hospitality
So order yourself a taste of yesterday at a Texas Cafe'
There's a Wurlitzer jukebox full of old forty fives
Playing three songs for a quarter or one for a dime
The cook said he was a boy when it was brand new
To him it seemed like yesterday but it was 1962
There was a family owned five and dime next door
That could not compete with a chain discount store
On the outskirts of town the drive in theater is shut down
With a screen without a hero since Audie Murphy[CHORUS]
There are fields with no grain, railroad tracks with no train
And an old courthouse with nobody left to blame
Town square is boarded up and brick roads are worn down
But the chicken fried steak special is still around[CHORUS]


I've got a girl and Charlene is her name
Since she flipped her skirt at me I ain't never been the same
All of the boys in our trailer park
Would take a bath and go to school just to win her heart
Her name is Charlene Gene, she's every rednecks dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 
Just the other day we were riding in my car
We got to Charlene's trailer and I pulled up in the yard
On her front porch was her old boyfriend Chase
He blew a little kiss at her so I kicked him in the face
Cause I love Charlene Gene, she's every redneck's dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 
Charlene's got a brother and his name is Jim
And she's got one other and his names the same as him
One of them is ugly and one of them is mean
But both of them together couldn't keep me from Charlene
Cause I love Charlene Gene, she's every redneck's dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 
Charlene's mom and daddy bought a brand new double wide
And when she moved away from me I will admit I cried
But that Friday night at the local quickie mart
A pretty girl winked at me and nearly stole my heart
Bobby Joe Briscoe the queen of the rodeo
She may be sweet on me but she don't even know
It don't matter how she butters up my bread
I'll always love someone else instead 
Cause I love Charlene Gene, she's every redneck's dream
Some people think the thing that I love most
Is the way that she butters up my toast
But most of most I love her lovely name 
But most of most I love her lovely name


His song comes on the radio, and brings back your memory*
And reminds me of the way that it used to be
You loved all his hits like "hello darlin" and "tight fittin' jeans"
I just wish your leaving were "only make believe"[Chorus:]
Every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you
And how we used to sing along to all the ones that we knew 
It's not that they aren't good I used to love them to
But every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you
He may have been the best friend that any song ever had
But when I hear that growl in his voice it always makes me sad
It hurts to hear him sing "I'm not through loving you yet"
Lord only knows what I'd give if I could forget[Chorus]
Daddy left us when I was only three
All he left behind were those Conway Twitty records and me[Chorus]
Momma every time I hear those songs it makes me think about you


Well... I been packed up some two weeks ago.
My truck's gased up and ready to roll.
Just might get a ticket or two,but that's alright.
Cause I'm going to Texas to see my baby tonight.
Thinkin' bout her sends chills up my spine.
There's a feelin' I get when I cross the state line.
Her pickup truck will be next to mine.
Cause I'm going to Texas to see my baby tonight.
Colorado's quite a sight
But I'd rather see my baby in those rugged mountain jeans.
Gettin cold at night,she can keep me warm
If you know what I mean [?] LoneStar shining bright.
Shines a little brighter,when she's with me.
So I'm going to Texas to see my baby tonight.
Live a long life livin out on the road.
When the only friend of yours' is the radio.
But even he fades out every now and then.
Girl I made a mistake I ain't goin to make again.
The closer I get seems the faster I go.
The only thing between us now is New Mexico.
It's just a matter of time before I hold her tight.
Cause I'm going to Texas to see my baby tonight.
(Take it home boys)[Repeat Chorus]
Going to Texas to see my baby tonight.


Sometimes she'll laugh
And sometimes she will cry
Sometimes she'll get mad at you
And leave you wonderin why
A woman's mind is a mystery
That no man can uncover
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
What she wants
And what she needs
May be two different things
And the words you hear so clear
Aren't always what they mean
She may say that she's cold at night
Just to have you hold her
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
The ocean doesn't ask why
The moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings she feels inside
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out show her you love her
If she smiles and says she loves you as the tears roll from her eyes
Then you've found a treasure
That only true love can find
A woman's heart has parts that will never be discovered
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
The ocean doesn't ask why the moon pulls the tide
So don't question the feelings she feels inside
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Show her you love her
If you had all of the answers
Tell me what would it matter
So don't waste your time trying to figure her out
Just show her you love her


Hold on my buddies
On the block good bye
As we drove away I wiped a tear from my eye
I thought my life had come to an early end
But this is where the story begins
My daddy promised me I'd make new friends
But still I wondered how in a town of only 10
There at the dairy queen my first night
Have mercy, it was love at first sight
Thank god for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank god for country girls
She was all by herself sittin' at a corner booth
Wearin' a summer dress and a pair of cowgirl boots
I heard her hummin' a Meral Hagard song
I looked down, my heart was gone
I walked up to her, she saw my hesitation
I asked if she had a dinner reservation
She said I'd love to have your company
I said hello love, goodbye mister lonely
Thank God for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank god for country girls
No, my friends back home were missin' out
So they came to see what the fuss was all about
Before the first night had come and gone
They were all singing my song
They said,
Thank god for country girls
Big blue eyes and long blond curls
I wouldn't miss this for the whole wide world
Thank god for country girls
Thank god for country girls


Here we go....
You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
For dancin' naked on New Year's Eve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I'll buy a one-way ticket to destination - you pick it
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Anytime you're nice, I can't help but think twice
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Aw yeah....


He starts to think when she winks that he's somewhere he shouldn't be
He may be alone but at home someone's wearing his ring
So he heads for the door and ignores the devil on his shoulder
He'll do the right thing but someone's gonna break down and hold her
And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
Once again another man walks in and orders him drinks for two
Despite his wife and picture perfect life he's to good to be true
While he's flirting she'd swear he's working on a job out of town
A married man, you know he's got no business messing around
And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
It's a five star chain or a run down dirt cheap no name
With or without room service what done is the same
And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel
In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale
If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell
There's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel


Like a killer at large
You strolled down Bourbon Street
Lookin' for an easy mark
With every man you meet
And I never saw the devil
Behind your rain blue eyes
Spellbound by your long legs and your little white lies
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
You're no Adalida, no pretty Cajun queen
Just a bad girl from Biloxi, more addicting than morphine
And when your love wears off
There's nothin' left but pain
And enough teardrops fall to flood Lake Ponchatrain
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
I can see you smilin' in some Creole cafe
Slippin' your love potion in someone's ettouffe
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls head over heels
Cause you'll tear it all apart just to see how it feels
How can you be so hot and so cold-blooded too
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you
Oh, heaven help the heart that falls in love with you


Well I was thumbing through the channels
And I saw a sight to see
A so-called country singer, there singing on MTV
And I began to think - had she ever heard a thing
Had she ever been to Texas where Bob Wills is still the king
Ah - ha
From the Houston rodeo to any old dancehall
Of cowgirls and cowboys know how to have a ball
And every night they'll tip a toast to the Lone Star state
Where the women are so fine and the music is so great
Cause I wanna two-step to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wanna-be country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Aw yeah...
All together now....
It's a Texas thing, Y'all
So if you don't understand just drop what you're doing
Drive here as quick as you can
I'd even stop in Oklahoma if it was up to me
Cause when it comes to country, there ain't none like 
I wanna two-step to a real dancehall swinger
I don't wanna see no wanna-be country western singer
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
That hip-hoppin' rappin' boy band crap is for the squirrels in San Francisco
And Nashville is making music that sounds like a dadgum disco
Don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
Yes, I said don't call it country unless you can prove it
I want something with a swing to it
That's right...


We both work hard for money already spent
Blaming each other for where it all went
Never thinking of love only paying the loans
Griping bout' bills and keeping up with the Jones
Just once let's forget about making ends meet
Or whose got the nicest yard on the street
Darlin' let loose, let your hair down
We're staying at home for a night on the town
So turn the music up, and dim the lights down 
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
When you're in my arms it makes me feel
Like I own a mansion on top of the hil
But it's not how big's the house it's how happy's the home
How poor is a rich man who lives all alone 
So turn the music up, and dim the lights down 
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance
So turn the music up, and dim the lights down 
Let those old records keep spinning around
Replace all our worries with some romance
Tell me you love me then we'll shut up and dance


With the world in the palm of his hands
Slipping through his fingers just like grains of sand 
He don't know his hourglass is losing time
Till she run out of patience and leaves him far behind 
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way 
Before they understand the way they feel 
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
If only she had a dime every time he's done her wrong
Or for every one wondering why she's still holding on
She could buy that rodeo and shut it down
Along with every honky tonkin' bar in town 
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way 
Before they understand the way they feel 
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will
It may be his fault but she's still one to blame
For taking him back and playing his foolish games
Some lovers gotta learn love the hard way 
Before they understand the way they feel 
Some lovers are slower than others
Some will come around and some never will


He calls from a hotel in downtown Dallas
Says he won't be home for three more days
She gets so lonely in her Houston hill top palace
Talking to her self as their two-year-old plays
She rocks the baby to sleep then gets in bed
Reads romance novels of a love she once had 
She closes her eyes and dreams about the man
Who gave her more than money and a call now and then [Chorus:]
As the shine on her diamond starts to fade
She recalls the promises they made
But a bond can only bend so far before it breaks
She's stuck between a rock and a heartache
She tries to keep busy with her everyday routines
Soap operas in the afternoons, after she cleans 
As she wipes off a picture frame from their wedding day 
She wonders if he asked her again what would she say [Chorus]
She feels like she's stranded somewhere in no man's land
Cause her life is like a prisoner's chained to a wedding band [Chorus]


Well I've done some things that I can't undo
I took your trust and I tore it into
No man in his right mind would have said it's over
Still I told you goodbye completely sober
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
My mama knows her baby boy knows better
It's gonna break her heart to hear we're not together
She's always said she cares so much for you
So what is she gonna say about the hell I've put you through
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
Even Tennessee whiskey couldn't wash away the pain
Watered down with teardrops over light Kentucky rain
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse
I wish I could say I'd been drinking
And blame the bottle but I've never been one to booze
Lord only knows what I was thinking
Wish I could say I'd been drinking
Even that's just a fool's excuse


I was singing at the ol' Broken Spoke 
I could have swore she came walking in
Forgot the words to a song that I wrote
Must be losing my mind once again
Her daddy is a southern Baptist preacher
I had to choose her or the bars where I sang 
Now when I call I can't seem to reach her
I'm gonna find her if it's the last thing[Chorus:]
So I'll drive all night long
Till I find where we went wrong
But there's no love in sight -
Just those lonely Lubbock lights
I was ready to give up the road
As I turned onto her street
But the silhouette there in her window
Was of someone who once looked like me
I'd placed a price on her heart
But someone else collected the bounty
Now this lost soul don't know where to start
I think I'm lost somewhere in Hale County[Chorus]
That west Texas wind grew colder
As I left her further behind me 
Sometimes I stop and cry on the shoulder
Cause every town I pass helps to remind me[Chorus]


Well, he's a no good for nothing
But she wishes he was good for something
Besides his behind looking so fine
In those wragler jeans
Well all her friends can't help but stare
At his blue denim derie'er
Wish that they were in her boots
If you know what i mean
And it may sound crazy 
But those wrangler butts
Drive the cowgirls nuts
Well he lays around all day long
Stays out at night until the break of dawn
Comes crawling in dragging
Mud across her floor
Well she'd love to kick him out
But she can't help but thinking about
All the women who are waiting line
For his 33/34's
And it may sound crazy 
But those wrangler butts
It ain't healthy if they fit too tight
You know this could hurt a man
By the end of the night
It's a powerful thing
If they fit just right
All the ladies know it's a mighty beautiful sight
Well he's never been one for anything
That involves books
He ain't got much going for him besides his good looks
You see he always stays in trouble
When it comes down to romance
It ain't a joke when they say the boy
Survives by the seat of his pants
And it may sound crazy 
But those wrangler butts
Drive the cowgirls nuts
Yes it may sound crazy 
But those wrangler butts 
Drive the cowgirls nuts


You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
I'm about to change your point of view [Chorus:]
You're messing with man on a mission
And a heart with hard headed ambition 
My sites are set on you, there's nothing you can do
You're messing with man on a mission
Darling I declare how dare you to compare
When you ain't ever loved no one like me
Unlike the other boys you may have played like toys
I'm more than a yo-yo on a string[Chorus]
You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
You'll be mine by the time I'm through[Chorus]


Deep in the mountain of Harlan County
Employed by the Cumberland coal company
The pay is short, the days are long
But our labor union laws are coming on strong
So I drink this whiskey for my throat
Wear my hard hat and weathered coat
Early every morning I stand in line
Waiting to work these Kentucky coal mines
We enter the shaft around five thirty
With two dozen hands, cold, callused and dirty
We'll dig through a million tons of rock and clay
And we'll still be digging at the end of the day
Down on our knees we confess our sins
And pray that the roof above don't cave in
So bless our hearts and save or souls
And the air we breathe down in the devil's hole
Just last week when the the ceiling fell
The explosion trapped us in the depths of hell
The weight of the earth took poor Tucker's life
Leaving behind a hungry baby and wife
We dug out with our shovels and picks
But soon enough the black lung disease will make us sick
So bless our hearts and save or souls
And the air we breathe down in the devil's hole
I work deep in the mountains of eastern Kentucky
I know if I leave Harlan alive I'll be more than lucky
Wish I could go to Texas and plant some cottonseed
But moving takes money and I've got three mouths to feed
So I drink this whiskey for my throat
Wear my hard hat and weathered coat
Early every morning I stand in line
Waiting to work another Kentucky coal mine


I got a letter from your lawyer
And you got one from mine
They say it's gonna be final
Once we sign that dotted line
We'll I guess we'll get our freedom
And a so called fresh new start
But when you take half of everything
You'll be taking half my heart
Our love got lost somewhere in life's complications
Torn between two lawyers and all their legal litigations 
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
I took down our wedding picture 
From above the fireplace
And I stood there awhile
Starring at your pretty face
Have we lost our love
To differences we can't resolve
But if push comes to shove
Thank God no children are involved
I can still see you throwing your rose bouquet 
I never thought I'd see the day we'd throw it all away
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
I've done all I can do now all I can do is pray
And ask the Lord to let me hear you say
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
Girl, off the record, I'm still in love with you


He calls from a hotel in downtown Dallas
Says he won't be home for three more days
She gets so lonely in her Houston hill top palace
Talking to her self as their two-year-old plays
She rocks the baby to sleep then gets in bed
Reads romance novels of a love she once had 
She closes her eyes and dreams about the man
Who gave her more than money and a call now and then [Chorus:]
As the shine on her diamond starts to fade
She recalls the promises they made
But a bond can only bend so far before it breaks
She's stuck between a rock and a heartache
She tries to keep busy with her everyday routines
Soap operas in the afternoons, after she cleans 
As she wipes off a picture frame from their wedding day 
She wonders if he asked her again what would she say [Chorus]
She feels like she's stranded somewhere in no man's land
Cause her life is like a prisoner's chained to a wedding band [Chorus]


[Chorus:]
Lord don't you walk with a little
Sawin' on a fiddle and the crying of a steel guitar
Coming from the heart and soul
Born and bred in the ole Lone Star
Get them honky tonkin' blues
Let them be your saving grace
If you want to hear some country
Then you've come to the right place
You miss Waylon, if it don't make you smile
Like Willie and George Jones
You better stick around a while
You like Merle, Buck and Johnny
We might just get along
But if you don't, go slap your mommy
Cause your momma raised you wrong[Chorus]
I like gravy on my biscuit, I like my chicken fried
I drink my coffee black, I sure like my Charlie Pride
Well I still solute ole Glory and I give glory to the lord
I tip my hat to ole E.T. and his Texas Troubadours[Chorus]


He's wrinkled and gray but he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage like a bird on a wire
He'll pack 'em in just like he always did
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
He got his first guitar when he was fifteen
Thirstin' for knowledge, all hungry and green
Strummin' that six string just like Lefty did
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid[Chorus:]
Well the Honky Tonk Kid loves a honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
All the smoke and the neon keep his pain here
Nobody knows The Honky Tonk Kid
Ten million fans and a hand full of friends
He'll go home alone when each night ends
He'll think about her and he'll twist off the lid
Cause nobody loves The Honky Tonk Kid[Chorus x2]
It won't be long the lord will take him away
He'd sung his last song, they'll place a reef on his grave
But he'll draw a crowd just like he always did
One last goodbye for The Honky Tonk Kid


I still think about us
In the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun
In nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing[Chorus:]
We hit the corners going 90
Lovin' blindly fallin' 
Head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
You were young, I was wild, we were reckless
We'd drive on down to the river 
Burnin' up those hot summer nights
Laughin' at the cowboys getting crazy 
Pickin' fights
It wasn't funny
When that deputy, caught you and me
Steaming up those windows 
And how your daddy never found out about it
Honey, heaven only knows[Chorus]
I looked into your eyes and I 
Promised you forever
I believed it with all my heart 
I just didn't know any better
Gettin' over you took years
Aww despite those tears I cried
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride[Chorus]
Young, wild, and reckless


She said she was not the one for me
There was nothing I could do to change her mind
She said she was sorry but some things aren't meant to be
She was unaware that she was robbing her heart blind[Chorus:]
What she don't know is I'll always love her forever
What she don't know is that I've never done her wrong
Underestimation will break her heart for sure
What she can't see, what she don't know
Won't hurt her but it's killing me
Deep in the shadows of the smokey neon lights
I play myself in a lonely game of pool
I chalk it up as he sits down by her side
I take another shot, swallow my pride and I play a fool[Chorus]
Watching her dance with him 
Around that empty hardwood floor
Is like putting sawdust in the wound
And I cry a little more[Chorus]


I'm tryin' not to panic, I'm gettin' all romantic
Gettin' soft with everything I say and do.
I'm talkin' hours on the phone, puttin' on that sweet cologne
I'm even puttin' down the toilet seat for you.
Aw, wait a minute, it gets worse.
I found myself holdin' your purse, standin' outside that bra and panty store.
My boss's wife walked by, she spotted me and told me hi
And I knew then, I was in for it for sure.
Now all the boys down at the shop know and they sure do find it funny.
They say you've changed my ways and that you're spending all my money, honey.[Chorus:]
If you're not in love,
If you're not in love,
If you're not in love,
Aw, if you're not in love,
Then I'm in a lot of trouble.
I got this lump in my throat, then I sold my boat
So I could buy this diamond ring for you.
Now I'm hopin' and I'm wishin' that since I can't go fishin',
You won't make me sell my golf clubs, too.
The boys down at the shop know and they laugh until I cry
I told 'em, if I mess this up, my momma's gonna tan my hide.[Chorus]
I gave up that can of Snuff, no more NASCAR on TV.
Honey, if that ain't enough, this may be the death of me.[Chorus x2]


I am flat dead on my feet
I have had nothing to eat
I am sick of highways and cold hotels rooms
I have replay there in our soft bed
I am so tired of missing you
So let's turn out the lights
(let's turn out the lights)
And lay here by my side
(lay here by my side)
Give me the lose that I need
Baby let's love some sleep tonight
All these shows that I play
Take me so far away
I know that I have negleated your needs
You have been tested and trialed
Stuck firm by my side
Waiting patiently for the man of your needs
So let's turn out the lights
(let's turn out the lights)
And lay here by my side
(lay here by my side)
Give me the love that I need
Baby let's lose some sleep tonight
Sweetheart one night together
Is not nearly enough
We need the rest of forever making up for lost love
So let's turn out the lights
(let's turn out the lights)
Lay here by my side
(lay here by my side)
Give you the love that you need
Let's lose some sleep tonight
The love that I need
Baby let's lose some sleep tonight


Ahh let's go honky tonkin' 
Let's go honky tonkin' 
Have a honky tonkin' good time with us 
Ahh let's go honky tonkin' 
Let's go honky tonkin' 
Honky tonkin' round Texas 
Well I'll put some diesel in the tank 
Give that old Detroit a crank 
We'll sit back and let that silver eagle fly 
Well up and down that Lonestar State 
Let's have a honky tonkin' tail gate 
And don't forget to kiss your baby good bye [Chorus]
Stick out a thumb and bum a ride 
Hitch-hike across the country side 
Come see why they call this place God's country 
Well criss-cross in the Colorado  
From Amarillo to Zapata 
Every town along the way from A to Z [Chorus]
Well my mom called me up 
And she gave me my last warning 
Said there'll be hell to pay 
If I miss church this Sunday morning


Well once upon a time 
When I held you in my arms 
On a blanket in the grass 
Where we'd watch the falling stars 
Under that old maple tree 
We'd share secrets in the dark 
Now I sit here all alone 
Watching children play 
In Mackenzie Park [Chorus:]
And we lived, laughed, and loved as if 
There were no tomorrow 
Up until the day you went away 
Leaving only sorrow 
Now the stars don't shine 
The way they used to do 
Like they did when you were mine 
Perhaps they're lonely too 
You can barely read the names 
That I carved inside a heart 
Now I sit here all alone 
Watching children play 
In Mackenzie Park [Chorus]
Sometimes I think of you 
And I just have to smile 
Though forever never was 
At least we had a little while 
How time flies when you're young 
Just like the flicker of a spark 
Now I sit here all alone 
Watching children play 
In Mackenzie Park


I've got this Caribbean queen 
Rubbin' in my coconut sunscreen 
You'd think you'd be the last thing on my mind 
I've got a beautiful ocean view 
Ten thousand miles from you 
So why couldn't I leave this broken heart behind 
Oh the sunshine is dancin' on the water 
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter 
If I keep tellin' myself 
I'm havin' the time of my life 
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you 
Welcome to a fool's paradise 
Well I keep on tellin' me 
There's other fish in the sea 
But your memory keeps reminding me I'm wrong 
There's a party 'bout every night 
And I should be out doin' it up right 
Instead of watchin' re-runs of Gilligan's Island all alone (all night long) 
Oh the moonlight is dancin' on the water 
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter 
If I keep tellin' myself 
I'm havin' the time of my life 
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you 
Welcome to a fool's paradise 
This time next week I'll be headed to Texas On a big jet airplane 
Oh when I get home you know this broken heart is gonna hit me like a hurricane 
Oh the sunshine is dancin' on the water 
Pretty girls couldn't get any hotter 
If I keep tellin' myself 
I'm havin' the time of my life 
Maybe it'll come true and I won't miss you 
Welcome to a fool's paradise


Well my truck's wound up and it's ready to roll 
I got a good buddy workin' for the Highway Patrol 
So if I get a ticket or two, It's gonna be alright 
But the sheriff and his boys they're in Estilline 
Unless they're out to lunch at the Dairy Queen 
They'll be itchin' to turn on those red, white, and blue lights 
Well just like my daddy I was born a drifter 
I got a rebel heart and eight - ball shifter 
Horns on the hood and forty channel CB 
Well some things you never leave home without 
Like your Bible, log book, and your drivin' route 
And your Best Of Dale Watson on CD [Chorus:]
Cause I'm a diesel drivin' daddy 
Don't you get in my lane 
Puttin' the pedal to the medal 
Bringin' eighteen wheels of pain 
I've been in love 
Broke some hearts 
Settled down long enough to replace the parts 
Kicked a little 
Asphalt along the way 
There's a lonely life livin' on the road 
When the only friend you've got is the radio 
And even he fades in and out every now and then 
But maybe someday you'll find the right one 
That'll shift the gears and let ya ride shotgun 
Knows how to get that big ole rig to spin [Chorus]
I'm a panhandlin' manhandlin' 
Post holin' high rollin' dust bowlin' daddy 
I ain't got no blood in my veins 
I just got them four lanes 
Of hard Amarillo highway [Chorus]
Up and down that honky tonkin' highway


Pinch me I must be dreaming waking up with you and feeling
The tender touch of your good morning kiss
No where else on earth is better than being next to you
Next to heaven, it doesn't get any better than this[Chorus:]
Next to heaven lies my fate, my best friend and my sole mate
God knows this kind of love only comes from up above
You're the answer to my prayers, nothing else compare
I'm next to heaven when I am next to you
You look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets
Lying there with your hair all in a mess
I swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing
Next to heaven, it doesn't get any better than this[Chorus x3]


I just called to say good bye
But I was hopin' that you would beg me not to go
You where my only reason for stayin'
Besides the amarillo winters are to cold to spend alone[Chorus:]
So what its worth
I'll be in fort worth
Just in case you ever start missin' me
I'm gonna be right here in fort worth
So for what its worth thats where I'm gonna be
Before the pain I put you through
Those late night calls from those random county jails
I know I swore never to bother you again
But if you don't mind could you find the time to forward me my mail[Chorus]
If you need a friend; a friendly conversation
You got my number and an open invitation[Chorus]


Will you love me in a trailer
Til I can get up on my feet
If it's August in Arizona
Could your heart stand the heat
I could never be an actor
Trying to be what I can't be
If I'm just a farm boy on a tractor
Could you love me just for me
And I can't offer you the stars above
Just next to nothing except my love
Of every day that I have to live
My everything's all I've got to give
Well old man Pete lives down the street
With his wife of sixty years
He said the hard times were bittersweet
And all they owned was a catalog from Sears
Mrs. Dorothy is his darlin'
She'd stand by him win or lose
She says now that they have money
Her only weakness is spending it on shoes
And I can't offer you the stars above
Just next to nothing except my love
Of every day that I have to live
My everything's all I've got to give


I said hey sugar mama

So lets have a ball at the ole dance hall
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Until the mornin light
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight

Theres only one thing on Gods green earth
To get this cruel world off my mind

So lets have a ball at the ole dance hall
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Until the mornin light
I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight

For those workin man blues
And Tuesday and Wednesdays more the same ole bad news
Well Thursdays ok and Fridays gettin brighter
When the whistle blows at 5:00
I'm comin home to pull an all-nighter
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
So lets have a ball at the ole dance hall
And later on we just might
Go make a little love beneath the moon above
Until the mornin light

So kick off your shoes, forget about your blues
And let your troubles take flight
Well you and me hun well have a little fun

So lets make a little love beneath the moon above
In the glow of a kerosene light
Well be turnin on and on til the break of dawn
Til we turn it on just right
Sugar mama I'm a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight
Im a gonna wanna gotta have a heyday tonight


For the life of me will her memory keep on keepin' me awake?
This empty pillow by my head is proof you sleep in the bed that you make
Just like a fool I did nothin', nothin' short of helpin' her pack
Wish I could find a way, find the words to say
To bring my baby back
I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
Thought she'd at least call to say that she was ok
While she left me walkin' the floor
Maybe she was long gone long before she ever set foot out that door
I guess over time the love in her heart was overshadowed by her heartaches
She didn't scream or shout, she had it all mapped out, and she never even tapped the brakes
I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
There goes my life down that highway
All of my dreams slippin' further away from this broken home
I've gotta put the pieces all back together
I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no signs of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
I've got a good thing goin'


Like that old Titanic 
Running full steam ahead
You fogged up my mind
With love words you said
I could not see the danger
I got myself in
Till my ship was sinking
And I couldn't swim
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
Now the door went under
In an ocean of regret
With no hope of rescue
From love I can't forget
I never knew just what hit me
To far gone to say
I never knew my heart 
Was in harm's way
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I couldn't see the truth
Till it was in my face
If I'd seen it coming
I could have turned away
I didn't know my heart
Was in harm's way
I didn't know my heart 
Was in harm's way


I held the keys to that Chevrolet 
and you held the keys to my heart
I'd throw a fit, hit the dash,
get out and kick the tire
when that old piece of junk wouldn't start
It'd be smoking good I'm slam down the hood
Just to see you laughing at me
On the other side of a dirty windshield,
lookin' as pretty as could be
We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17
In the blink of an eye high school flew by
you went your way and I went mine
But we swore we'd make it,
our love could take it
400 miles could stand the test of time
Well I left that fall to play college ball,
but my dreams would all come to an end
'Cause you know the big leagues never called,
and you went and fell in love with him
We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17
Memories flash through my mind like old faded photographs
I still think about you in that red Malibu
and I just can't help but laugh
We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17
Love broke down around 3rd gear and 17
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17


Whenever she walks flowers grow in her footsteps
Whenever she talks all the birds hush their singing
The heart of a saint and the face of an angel
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful
And when this cruel world's been gettin' me down
She'll take my frown and she'll turn it back around
Like a clown, she'll crack a joke
Acting crazy as a fool
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful[Chorus]
It'd be a big old fat lie, if I said I
Wasn't turned on just by her looks alone
She's so much more, so much more than meets the eye
She's an angel on loan from up above
And when I come home and the day is sinkin down
She'll set the mood and put some soft slow music on
And all 7 wonders ain't half as wonderful
Never ceases to amaze me
The epitome of what love should be
Absolutely unbelievably beautiful


Sometimes I hear a woman cryin
And a man sayin nothin at all
Often I hear children laughin
And footsteps walkin down the hall
There's a ghost for every memory
Always remindin me that I was wrong
And since her leavin
I've been sleepin
Leavin all of the lights on[Chorus:]
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
Haunted by the sounds of broken hearts
Rattlin off the chain of broken vows
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house
There's no place to run and hide
I swear she's everywhere I go
In every room I, smell her perfume,
I know she's not here
But I'm not alone[Chorus]
It sends a chill through my bones
It's got me scared as a mouse
Now empty and alone
What was once a happy home
Feels more like a haunted house


I'm a game that you used to play
And I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well
And I'm a fire that burns in your mind
So close your eyes I'm a memory
I'm a love that you bought for a song
And I'm a voice on a green telephone
And I'm a day that lasted so long
So close your eyes I'm a memory
I'm a dream that comes with the night
And I'm a face that fades with the light
And I'm a tear that falls out of sight
So close your eyes I'm a memory
I'm a love that you bought for a song
And I'm a voice on a green telephone
And I'm a day that lasted so long
So close your eyes I'm a memory


We'd walk up and down the Concho River
We'd find a soft place to watch the sun go down
So was it me or was it what I could not give you
She left me shattered, my life scattered all around[Chorus:]
She said time would heal my broken heart
and I'd find a true companion for my soul
You know she was right, we were wrong 
Nothing more than a pretty song
About a boy who loved a girl
In San Angelo[Repeat Intro]
When I'd close my eyes, I could hear her singing
In the chapel where she said we'd wed someday
It rattled me so to hear them old church bells ringing
Knowing well enough we'd never love that way[Repeat Chorus]
Looking back it was a blessing she broke my heart in two
But if I had never lost her, baby I'd have never found you[Repeat Chorus]
About a boy who once loved a girl in San Angelo


Well before she came along he was lonesome onry and mean
It was his way or the high way
But she had a way that he'd never seen
He'd been livin hard and fast
All his takin was takin its toll
And it took a good hearted, hard headed angel
To help him gain control
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldn't see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Except for Jessie
Well she never tried to change him
But she loved him and gave him a son
And that ain't easy with a honky tonkin man
Makin music on the run
And Lord knows she was a good wife
Always good at findin ways to right his wrongs
She was the love of his life, the inspiration for his songs
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldn't see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Except for Jessie
He wore his own kind of hat
And for that folks called him an outlaw
Well some even cussed his name
Cause they couldn't see the same man she saw
He strummed the beat of a different drum
And his hair was always long and messy, yes it was
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
Except for Jessie


Your standing there, that look in your eye
Your looking for good ways to tell me goodbye
Something about people how they never know
They're loving somebody then letting them go
Your looking for reasons there ain't no need
You can blame it on me.[Chorus:]
You can blame it on me. I was the one
Acting like real life was some old love song
I held you too close; I couldn't let go
You can't loose your cool these days I know
So I'll go on home and you can feel free
You can blame it on me
Well I am too rough; I work too hard
I've got no cool friends, driving ol' cars
I'm not the picture of anyone's dreams
I'm full of bluebonnets, boots and old Jeans
Your looking for reasons -
There ain't no need; you can blame it on me.[Chorus]
When you start looking
For ways outta love
Then I've been making mistakes by the dozen
So if you wanna leave
You can blame it on me
I held you too close; I couldn't let go
You can't loose your cool these days I know
So I'll go on home and you can feel free
To blame it on me.
All on Me
You can blame it on me


If you'd had made a tag on the back
Of those designer jeans she's wearin'
It's some big name brand you can't buy at a Wal-mart
And you from what she's got on
From her Versace to her Louis Vuitton
You wouldn't think she'd know every Merle Haggard song by heart
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
Well she comes pullin' up to you at a red light
In some high-fallutin fancy foreign car
Rich lady shades and a little dog in the window
You'd never know she was born and raised right down on her grandaddy's farm
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
There's somethin' bout her slow southern twang
It sweet talks me into anything
Her smile, her wink, and her pretty please
Brings any country boy down to his knees
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation 
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl


Just you know why 
Why you and I 
Will by and by
Know true love ways

Just you and I 
Know true love ways
Throughout the days 
Our true love ways 
will bring us joys to share 
with those who really care 
Sometimes we'll sigh

And we'll know why 
Just you and I 
Know true love ways
Throughout the days

With her little one in one arm
And the laundry in the other
She could sure use a helping hand
But thats just the life of a single mother
Somebody's calling on the phone
Somebody's knocking at the door
She forgets and burns the dinner
Throws it across the kitchen floor
And for a moment she wants to give up and break down
But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby
And when the day is done
She'll tuck her angel in
She'll turn out the lights and start missing him again
Her mascara slowly runs down her face
But nobody's crying but the baby
She ain't far from going crazy
And there are times she wonders how she's going to make it
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying 
But the baby is getting older
The lonely nights are getting colder
And what she wouldn't give to have a shoulder to cry on
But she's got to be strong enough for two
She's gotta do what he wouldn't do
No time for tears around here
Nobody's crying but the baby


I don't know how to explain it
But I know the words will hardly do
Miracles, signs, and wonders aren't enough for me to prove to you
But don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will
Greater love has not a man than the one who gives his life to prove
That he would do anything
And that's what I'm gonna do for you
But don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will
But don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you...
Don't you know I've always loved you
Even before there was time
And though you turn away, I tell you still
Don't you know I've always loved you
And I always will


12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 13 Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 14I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.


Well God bless Texas
And Deakon Shackleford
He read the bible seven times
And he believed every word
That ol' beat up leather book had been through it all
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw
Singin'
"Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound"
That saved a wrech like me
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishin' after church 
And taught me things I needed to know
No, Deakon didn't have a family
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid[Chorus:]
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns 
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down the street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tatoo
He was on a ship off at sea when she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from the far side of the earth
He lost the will to love
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah life took him to hell and back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Singin'
"I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind
But now I see"[Chorus]
Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down the street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showing off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
Sweet chariots coming forth to carry me home


Well I was born on the banks of a river
Cool and clear runnin' deep and wide
So I put my feet in the rushin' water
And felt the freedom runnin' deep inside
And though I wander through the darkened valley
Well it was there to lead me home
Whenever I needed a little peaceful healin'
Well you can find me where the river flows
Those sheltered days are so far behind me
And now I travel unchartered ground
My steps may lead me through the barren desert
But I won't lose sight of where I am bound
My feet grow weary through life's journey
Still there's a place where I can go
Whenever I'm needin' a little peaceful healin'
You can find me where the river flows
Now if you're searchin' for the river
Listen close and you can hear it runnin' on and on
When I reach the end of this road I've taken
And I feel cold wind down in my bones
Well I'll be needin' a little peaceful healin'
And you will find me where the river flows
And though I wander through the darkened valley
It's always there to lead me home
Whenever I'm needin' a little peaceful healin'
Yes, you will find me where the river flows
Yes, you will find me where the river flows


I met Jesus in a bar
I guess you just can't fall too far
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar
Man or angel, son of God he did not tell me who he was (but I knew)
In that least expected place I saw heaven in His face and couldn't move
We sat there for hours, I could feel His grace and power
and I said things I'd never told a soul
I asked for forgiveness, he said I've already done this don't you know?
I met Jesus in a bar
I guess you just can't fall too far
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar
I started cryin' in my hands when I looked up again, He was gone
Then I walked the whole way home for the first time knowin' I was not alone
Some meet Him on the highway, some meet Him on a Sunday on the back row of the church
But I can only tell you my way was in a place where people go to hurt
I met Jesus in a bar
I guess you just can't fall too far
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar
I was pourin' whiskey in an empty heart
When I met Jesus in a bar


I just know the sunsets are to die for
How I long to walk upon that distant shore
I'll find my truest relaxation at my final destination when I take that long vacation with the Lord
I recall all the stories I've been told
I've read about heaven and its streets of gold
I'm prayin' and I'm wishin' ol' Saint Peter takes me fishin'
My bags are packed up and ready to roll
I just know the sunsets are to die for
How I long to walk upon that distant shore
I'll find my truest relaxation at my final destination when I take that long vacation with the Lord
Yes, He paid the price for my admission
I've got my one-way ticket and that's a trip I won't be missin'
I've had a few reroutes and stops along the way, but His grace is gonna get me there someday
I just know the sunsets are to die for
How I long to walk upon that distant shore
I'll find my truest relaxation at my final destination when I take that long vacation with the Lord
I'm gonna take that long vacation with the Lord
I'm gonna take that long vacation with the Lord


12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.


When wilted and whithered
And dyin' of thirst
In need of forgiveness
When you're at your worst
Let the rain fall upon you
Like sweet mornin' dew
Wash away all your sorrows
And let the Son shine on you
Let the Son shine from heaven
Through the clouds in the sky
Come receive your salvation
From His sacrifice
And when you're down and discouraged
And your heart's torn in two
You turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you
I've been there before
And I know your pain
Surrounded by darkness
All alone and ashamed
While you're out on life's highway
The wrong turn can leave you lost
So when you come to the crossroad
Take the road to the cross
Let the Son shine from heaven
Through the clouds in the sky
Come receive your salvation
From His sacrifice
And when you're down and discouraged
And your heart's torn in two
Turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you
And when you're down and discouraged
And your heart's torn in two
You turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you
Turn your face to the Father
And let His Son shine on you


24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God? Through Jesus Christ our Lord!


Well I’m just an old chunk of coal
But I’m gonna be a diamond some day
I’m gonna grow and glow ‘til I’m so blue, pure perfect
I’m gonna put a smile on everybody’s face
But I’m gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way
I’m just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I’m gonna be a diamond some day
I’m gonna learn the right way to talk
I’m gonna search and find a better way to walk
I’m gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
Until I get rid of every single flaw
I’m gonna be the world’s best friend
I’m gonna go around shakin’ everybody’s hand
I’m gonna be the cotton-pickin’ rage of the age
Yes, I’m gonna be a diamond some day
I said, ‘I’m just an old chunk of coal, my Lord
But I’m gonna be a diamond someday’


Tempted and tried, we’re oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long,
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.[Chorus:]
Farther along we’ll know all about it,
Farther along we’ll understand why;
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine,
We’ll understand it all by and by.
When we see Jesus, coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the sky,
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion,
We’ll understand it all by and by.[Chorus]


Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.
When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.


What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.


When I left Tulsa she was still an innocent lady
Lord only knows why she loved a guy like you
She called me cryin and she said she was havin your baby
You turned your back on her and broke her heart in two
I swore id get you for what you're puttin me through
And the only reason I ain't got you
She begged me not to says she loves you[Chorus:]
But don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
If the sun goes down on you
If you're still here you're goin down too
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
Shes the only thing I've ever really cared for
No she don't deserve this kind of shame
She carries a burden around that
You know you are to blame for
And you just laughed and said
They ain't gettin your name
I swore id get you for what you're puttin me through
And the only reason I ain't got you
She begged me not to says she loves you[Repeat Chorus]


He'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her again, again and again
He musta brought the jukebox cause those old sad songs they just won't end, they just won't end
His old broken heart, it still burns with desire
Cause you cant put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire[Chorus:]
And tonight he'll make a toast to her memory
And then he'll take another shot of a 100 proof of misery
And his old broken heart still burns with desire
Cause you cant put out an old flame
By pouring whiskey on the fire
His tears fall like rain but his pain just wont die down
Cause theres another blaze thats brewin as he buys another round[Repeat chorus]
He'll start drinkin, and he'll start thinkin about her again


Hey honey so what we had a little fight
We both said some things that we didn't mean last night
Yeah we should of kissed and made up instead of giving up
And getting up on the wrong side of the bed
And lord knows that I'm an early riser
And with this new day he sent me a reminder
Just as sure as the sun keeps risin
True love is true and it knows no compromisin'[Chorus:]
So what part of I love you don't you understand
Maybe you should take a wiff in that old big red coffee can
And if you still cant see you're the one and only one for me
And always will be heres a kiss and a cup
Sweetheart wake up and smell the coffee
Lookin right here at the front page of this mornins paper
Just bad news and headlines of hatred and anger
This old cruel world they'll try to bring it to the ground
But ill be danged if its gonna keep on keepin the good luck down[Repeat chorus]
Honey ain't that just like a woman
Makin somethin out of nothin at all
Then again ain't that just like a man
Acting bullet proof and ten foot tall[Repeat chorus]
Heres a kiss and a cup
Sweetheart wake up
Heres a kiss and a cup
No I wont give up
Heres a kiss and a cup
Sweetheart wake up
And smell the coffee


Girl I hate to see you cry
Laying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears and listen
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way that it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Now you know it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
There in the circle of your friends
We'll defend the silver lining
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way that it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who is misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good


Theres way too many lyin, stealin, cryin
Cheatin fool hearted drinkin songs
About somebody who done somebody wrong
Honey honky tonkin is what I do
But my true love is lovin on you
So baby tonight we gonna write a love makin song[Chorus:]
We could kick it off slow with a bottle of wine
Or get straight to the old punch line
Either way it starts its gonna end
With an all night long
Its guaranteed to be off the charts
Solid gold number one in my heart
Baby tonight we gonna write a love makin song
Girl I get inspired by watchin you
The sweet things you say and do
And baby you got a few ideas of your own
Well kiss for kiss and note for note
Shut the door and lock the dead bolt
Cause baby tonight we gonna write a love makin song[Repeat chorus][Repeat chorus]


Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
That my heart is breaking and this big ol' rig is shaking
I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her
Well she packed her bags and rented a U-Haul
Unhitched my heart hit the road around nightfall
Now I'm throwin hubs and speeding out of control
She never said where she was going but she said where I could go
Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
That my heart is breaking but I don't smell no bacon
So I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her
Well we took that big trip on down the aisle
Everything was hunky dory for a while
Now this Detroit is winding, my mind is grinding gears
I can hardly see the road with this truck load of tears
Breaker breaker one nine is someone out there on that line
If you see my girl won't you please remind her
I've got Smokey on my tail and unless I go to jail
I'm gonna keep that hammer down until I find her


Now he don't expect her to stay true to him
And she never says that she will
But hes got a first love that just might kill him
And she knows hes hooked on the thrill
So she'll wait and worry then she'll wait some more
For the fever that drives him to just run its course
She talks to that picture they took their last night together
Says you can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever
Sometimes he calls her he swears that the ground hurts more than it did yesterday
She knows his voice and he still sounds determined to do whatever it takes
So she'll wait and worry then she'll wait some more
For the fever that drives him to just run its course
The whiskey he drinks said some things last spring that upset her
Lord he can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever
Then one night he shows up and says whats for dinner
With that cocky grin on his face the way that she smiled
And the way that she held him, told him he wasn't too late
She closed her eyes and he put that ring on her finger
Said you can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever
No you can't be a cowboy forever


I can still see you standing there next to me in the county fair ticket line
With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hand in mine
It seems just like yesterday, letter jackets and football games girl
We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears[Chorus:]
We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight
Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride
Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile[Chorus]
Baby you still drive me crazy, you still make my heart skip a beat
With those butterfly first time feelings you've always kept me on the edge of my seat


The words cannot express, the way you look in that white dress
I don't believe theres ever been such a beautiful sight.
All my dreams are coming true, that yellow rose ain't got nothing on you
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight.
And tears will be falling everywhere, as your lettin down your hair
From cowboys wishin, that it was them holding you tight
Well thats the harsh reality, Id feel the same if you hadn't chose me
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
The lone star is shining bright above, and theres magic in the air
But looking deep into your eyes, I cant help but sympathize
For those who will never know, the kind of love we share
And tears will be falling everywhere, as your lettin down your hair
From cowboys wishin, that it was them holding you tight
Well thats the harsh reality, Id feel the same if you hadn't chose me
Hearts are breaking across Texas tonight
Yes Hearts are breaking across Texas


Born and raised in oklahoma the young man moved to tennessee
He started runnin with the devil chasin that honky tonkers dream
Well at some dive out on life's highway headed southbound
She was sent from up above and her true love turned his world around[Chorus:]
God bless angels and pray for outlaws
To find a new found love for their lost cause
Lord knows she loved him despite all his flaws
And he loved her cause she made him wanna be
A better man
No there weren't no halo above her beautiful brown hair
No he never saw her wings he always knew that they were there
Lord she had this way of knowin when he needed her the most
Its like she had some kind of connection with the father son
And the holy ghost[Repeat chorus]
Lord know it wasn't cold as hell
Like everybody thought it would be
Lord it was actually a beautiful july morning
When he and that preacher man came walkin
Up out of that tree[Repeat chorus]
He loved her cause she made him wanna be
A better man
And he was


Shes as pure as a sunday morning
Just as fun as a saturday night
Shes as pretty as a stain glass window
Shes always shining like a neon light
When I'm holding her here in my arms
I feel as if there's nothing i cant do
But just the thought of her leaving me
Leaves me helpless and broken in two[Chorus:]
My sweet contradiction knows well the chains that bind me
My cure and my addiction is her love and only her love
Can set me free
And no I don't understand what did I do to deserve to be her man
Shes such an angel so why is she flying so low
So she can love someone like me[Repeat chorus][Repeat first verse]
Yeah shes my sweet, shes so sweet
Shes my sweet contradiction
That girl is sweet, shes so sweet
Shes my sweet contradiction


By that look on your face
I know you know whats on my mind
Honey it's really half your fault
Standing there looking that fine
I swear I can't believe my eyes
You look so good it almost hurts
Wearing nothing but a smile
And one of my old favorite sweatshirts[Chorus:]
If you're wanting a reaction
Girl I'm fixing to ignite
You say it takes two to tango
So put on your dancin' shoes tonight
There's still that magic when we touch,
Just like I felt the very first time
And I have to pinch myself cause
I still can't believe you're mine
Lord knows I'm blessed to be the man
Who gets to sweep you off your feet
When it comes to loving you,
You know I never miss a beat[Chorus]
There's a full moon shining and
Baby we're both fixing to find
What you get when you mix
Soft kisses with a little red wine[Chorus]

I heard someone out poking fun 
At the ol' country boy and the songs that he sung 
Still cracking jokes he sarcastically implied 
Let me guess your girls gone and your dog just died, 
and I said hey...
That's what I like about a country song
where somebody done somebody wrong
Not just something that is understood, 
by those high rollers in Hollywood
It's about real folks living a real life with real problems, like and old ex wife
If you agree with the boys and me then sing along, 
that's what I like about a country song 
Some like to rock, some like to roll
Some like it fast and some like it slow
If you're left or right or right down the middle 
Everybody stops to listen when that bow hits the fiddle 
It's music for the rich or poor, 
hot mamas driving to the grocery store
All the farmers, the doctors, 
the truckers and the teachers 
The young punks, the old drunks, 
even Church of Christ preachers 
PRAISE THE LORD!
That's what I like about a country song
where somebody done somebody wrong
Not just something that is understood, 
by those high rollers in Hollywood
It's about real folks living a real life with real problems, like a future ex wife
If you agree with the boys and me then sing along, 
that's what I like about,
that's what I like about,


Wild Horses & honky Tonkin' bars
Drives a man to chase gold buckles and guitars
I don't do it for the money I can't blame the fame
It's been a long hard ride, still I saddle up just the same
I'm rolling right along, sky above is blue
I got the window rolled down and I'm listening to Chris Ledoux
Half a can of caffeine running through my veins
Running rain or shine and I'm never pulling back the reins
No you may not see me on your TV, I'm seldom heard on your radio
But if your looking, you might just find me somewhere between 
The road and the rodeo


I'm there to greet you when your life begins
You'll start your journey on your knees and hands
I offer many choices an' places you can go
'Cause you must choose 'cause I'm just the road
I'm paved with mem'ries, glory and regrets
I'm lined with broken dreams and cigarettes
You can take all you can hold but if you stumble b'neath your load
Don't blame me; I'm just the road
I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road
Road to riches, the path of righteousness
Through busy cities, or through a mountain mess
I'll take you through the high way or snake you through the low
But it's your call, I'm just the road
I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road
Your last breath is not the death of me
I'll take you on to where your ticket reads
To that place where I hope shinin' angels greet your soul
If they don't, I'm just the road
'Cause I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road
I'm a million miles before you, I'm a million miles behind
I'll take you straight and narrow, I'll ramble and I'll wind
So curse my broken brimstone or kiss my bricks of gold
I'm not the reason, I'm just the road
So don't you thank me don't you blame me
When you're at that judgment throne
'Cause I'm not the reason, I'm just the road


Some days are diamonds
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden 
And then fade away
And if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday 
You got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the dangers
And holds in the pain
Sometimes you're happy
Sometimes you cry
And half of me is ocean
And half of me is sky
'Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Somethings are over
Somethings go on
Part of me you carry
And part of me is gone
'Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
'Cause you got a  heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever 
Even walls fall down


He made the heavens and the earth
Separated day from night
He made man and it was good
Still something wasn't right
And all creation stood in awe
At the woman standing there
Wearing nothing but a smile
And a flower in her hair
And all along, the good lord knew
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
There was someone who broke my heart
Long before I fell for you
I would have swore she was the one
I thought she was my dream come true
As all the walls came crashing down
I hit my knees right there
Looking back I'm thanking God
For that unanswered prayer
And all along, the good lord knew
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
How can I describe my love for you
You're my life you're my whole wide world
It's kinda like a feeling I feel holding our new born baby girl
And all along, the good lord knew
What the world would be like without a girl like you
Your love's the kind of beautiful
That will never be surpassed
Now I know why he saved the best for last
Now I know why he saved the best for last


She was home all alone on a Saturday Night
She was all dressed up, not a thing going on
When this online dating infomercial caught her eye
She laughed and thought to herself
All the good ones are gone,
Still she jumped on the net, filled out her registration
Well luckily gave her a age and occupation
How much do you make what do you love to do
Take care congratulations found the perfect match for you
She thought oooh. last thing I need is another
Pickup truck and some pickup line oooh. from some wannabe cowboy
Wasting my time with red roses and wine
I love fast cars, slow kisses, John Wayne movies
And I don't mind dancing, I wanna fall in love
Wanna waltz across Texas, looking for a good ole' fashion romance
Now at the very same time, on the other side of town
His busted up broken heart, was lookin for a rebound
And that online dating infomercial caught his eye
He had nothing to lose so he gave it a try
He thought ooh. last thing I need is another pretty girl
Who just wants to have fun oooh. but when he read what she wrote
That is when he said to himself, this one's the one
I love fast cars slow kisses, John Wayne movies
And I don't mind dancing, I wanna fall in love
Wanna waltz across Texas, I'm looking for a good ole' fashion romance
Oooh. some find true love in a bar, in a church love will find you
Where ever your at, they struck a match made in heaven
Who wouldn't want to find something like that,
They loved fast cars slow kisses, John Wayne movies
And they don't mind dancing, they walk down the isle
Then they waltz across Texas, finally found a good ole fashion romance
Good 'ole country fashion romance, fast cars slow months


O, lord save my soul
I like to get a little loud
Goes without saying I suppose
I've got this thing for old guitars
Honky Tonkin' bars and my honey suckle rose
Cuz she's as sweet as she can be
She keeps me coming back around, and around
Seems I'm always on the fly
When that ramblin' fever rises high
She brings my temperature back down
She always does
I'd be an out of control, wild, and wonderin' gypsy soul
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart
I'm like a full time job
Sometimes a household chore
I wonder when she said I do
If she truly ever knew
What our future had in store
Somehow she still believes in me
Through all my many winds of change
Some have faith it will move a mountain
Lord she's got the kind that will move the mountain range
She always moves me
I'd be an out of control, wild and wonderin' gypsy soul
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart
I'd be an out of control, wild and wonderin' gypsy soul
And I know without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart
A love like this is like a slow train
I'm bound to crash and burn, derail, twist and turn
My life is borderline insane
I'd been an out of control, wild and wonderin' gypsy soul
Without her love I'd fall apart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart
That girl of mine must be plum half way out of her mind
For loving me, God Bless her crazy heart


I sat down at a park bench watching my children play
When this old timer took a seat he said hello how's your day
Said to tell you the truth I shouldn't be here doing this
Between the headlines and deadlines I've got no time to reminisce
That's when he said sounds like you're a busy man son that ain't front page news
He said once upon a time I was wearing your brand of boots so listen up
I've gone the wrong way I've learn the hard way
Baby's crawls then they walk before you know it
There driven away
As your staring at the tail lights you can feel life passing you by
It goes zero to sixty in the blink of the eye
He took a picture from his wallet that he carried threw out the war
Of the beautiful brunet he married in 1944
My angel flew way it's almost been five years
And he told me her name then he wiped away his tear
Then he said take a look at your little girl
Enjoy that little girl smile
Because on day your gonna turn around you'll be walking her down the isle[Repeat Chorus]
So count your many blessing and love with all your heart and hold on tight
You better cherish every morning and hit your knees every night
So I said lord I've gone the wrong way I've learned the hard way
We live we die the years fly by like white lines on the high way
Slow me down and make me see
The kind of man I need to be
Zero to sixty lives goes zero to sixty the old man said
I've gone the wrong way I've learn the hard way
Baby crawls then they walk before you know it
There driven away
As your staring at the tail lights you can feel life passing you by
It goes zero to sixty in the blink of the eye... in the blink of the eye


Well rumor has it so they say
She was broke down on the highway
She was checkin' it out
She was underneath the hood
When up rolled some country boys up to no good and makin' noise
To help the lady out like a good ole boy should
The two came up on each side and said
Hey honey you want a ride
One winked and the other gave her a little pinch
And so the story goes she hauled off and broke his nose
With her daddy's diamond horseshoe monkey wrench
She's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Well pretty girls these days get straight on top in so many ways
Things in show biz and those glamour magazines
Nah she's not one to befriend the latest so called fashion trend
She just naturally looks fine in those tight blue jeans
She's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
No she's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Boys you been warned so now you know
So straighten up and act your age
You'll be lookin' down the barrel
Of her daddy's 12 guage
She's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
Lord she's a high-stakin', heart breakin', absolutely breath- takin',
Make no mistakin', she's mighty hard of holdin', many cowboys tried, many a cowboy dang near died
She's no sweetheart of the rodeo
No she's no sweetheart of the rodeo


Out with the old.
And in with the new.
That's what they say,
Those who don't have a clue.
You're fighting this rain.
You're willing the shine.
You can't help yourself.
But i know you are trying.
When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight 
Over what they should do 
With this problem and you 
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Still chasing a dream
You're facing the facts
The weight of the reel
No more regrets
No looking back 
The problem to big
The tower to high
Yes says the heart
But no says the mind
When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight 
Over what they should do 
With this problem and you 
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
I wish this world apart
Where I could give you all the answers
But the fight continues on
And the fact of the matter
Is I am convinced we all 
spend far too much time on the fence 
Choosing sides
Tell me which is right
When your heart and your head disagree
Then I'll bet if you made them unite
There would be such a fight 
Over what they should do 
With this problem and you 
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Don't know how to resolve this conflict
Tell me how to resolve this conflict


Well, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Oh, Houston
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through
Well, honey, you and
God in Heaven above know I love what I do for a livin', I do
Ah, but Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Well, singin' at the world's biggest rodeo show
Was a great time for me and the guys
Ah, but when I'm away from you, honey
Time always never flies
And sleepin' all alone in that holiday hotel
Sure makes a cowboy blue
Ah, but here I am in Houston
And I'm one day closer to you
Well, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Oh, Houston
Houston means the last day of the tour and we're through
Well, honey, you and
God in Heaven above know I love what I do for a livin', I do
Ah, but Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Well, Houston

Well, honey, you and
God in Heaven above know I love what I do for a livin', I do
Ah, but Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you
Well, honey, Houston
Houston means that I'm one day closer to you


About every time you turn on your television there's another so-called movie star either suing somebody or going back to jail or out of rehab and right back to the bar.
I bet you heard about the two celebrities.
They threw away a fortune on their wedding day.
Looking back they should have fed half the world instead and now they are getting a divorce in LA.
So you can keep your caviar and your champagne and your million dollar mansion in Bel-Air.
Who really cares if you drive a Maserati? Who gives a flip about the fancy clothes you wear?
Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness.
No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss. 
Oh poor poor little rich girl, her daddy has hotels to burn.
She's got a slogan that's hot, talent that's not, no she don't have a care or concern.
She's got a private jet, videos on the net, and VIP parties every other hour.
She's got her BFF, an entourage, and a chef. Ego bigger than the Eiffel Tower. 
Honey you can keep your caviar and your champagne and your million dollar mansion in Bel-Air.
Who really cares if you drive a Maserati? Who gives a flip about the fancy clothes you wear?
Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness.
No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss. 
Supermodel, rock stars, hundred thousand dollar cars, treating life like a pleasure cruise.
You know there's not a lot of difference between cheap toilet paper and the supermarket tabloid news.
Now you can throw a hissy fit, you can blame it on the fame, or the pressure and the paparazzi but what we all really need is lots of love from above and a little more and more less vanity. 
So you can keep your caviar and your champagne and your million dollar mansion in Bel-Air.
Who really cares if you drive a Maserati? Who gives a flip about the fancy clothes you wear?
Cause all the money in your dog eat dog kind of world couldn't buy you a lick of happiness.
No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss. 
No Hollywood wouldn't know love if love walked up and gave Hollywood a kiss.


The full moons glowing out so bright 
It's light out on the highway
I can't hear the engine for the 
Wheels out on the road
The wind is blowing freezing
But it keeps my eyes wide open
It's 3AM an drivin's far 
And it hauls a heavy load 
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long
100 miles from no where
There are houses on the highway
Empty and a dark place 
That someone once called home 
Maybe they put sheets on chairs
And tables like the movies
But I know in that in real life 
There as empty as my soul
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long
And if I fail and I turn my wheel
Into that semi coming
I know well that there's a man in there 
Just trying to get home
And waiting up and worrying 
Is a woman loves him dearly
Ain't thinking clearly 
Cause I been drivin all night long
People think I'm lazy
And I'm scared to just stop runnin
People think I'm crazy
And I don't know that she's gone
But I know that I got 200 miles 
To make fore mornin
I don't think too much
Cause I been drivin all night long
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long
I got to tell her that I'm sorry
I got to tell her I was wrong
I got to show her I still love her
And I been drivin all night long


Just a worn out truck, a coffee cup
And another night out on the interstate
It's not exactly where he thought he'd be
When he reached this age
There is an old man staring back at him in the rear view
With a million miles of life in his eyes
And makes him ask those questions he don't want to
Oh, but it might be time
Does a shooting star miss the sky
When it hits the ground?
And how long can a woman go on loving you
If you're not around?
The years are flying faster now
So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow
And I wonder where old cowboys go
After the rodeo
There's a house and eighty acres he calls home
When he's not on the road
And a woman who's been true to him so long
But lonely, sure gets old
Lately he's been thinking 'bout her all the time
And on nights like this he'll miss her most of all
His body and his mind knows that he needs to find
A softer place to fall
Does a shooting star miss the sky
When it hits the ground?
And how long can a woman go on loving you
If you're not around?
The years are flying faster now
So tell me how eight seconds feel so slow
And I wonder where old cowboys go
After the rodeo
Lord, I wonder where old cowboys go


So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.
So honey lets find a little fun, make a little noise, throw a little sawdust on a hardwood floor,
wanna shine that buckle, while I’m holdin’ you tight, on a good time lonestar Saturday night
Naw, don’t worry bout the preacher man, he used to play fiddle in a honkey tonk band.
I’ll have you there bright and early in the front row pew, Lord knows I love lovin on you
So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.
Call your Mama, tell her don’t wait. Leave the light on cause we’re gonna be late.
Gonna do it up right, Gonna shut the place down, Gonna find a highway a little ways from town, 
Down a dirt road, past a windmill, round the pumpjack just over the hill,
there’s a tire swing hangin from a live oak tree, we can flip skinny dippin down in the creek
So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.
Girl let me love you, like its our last night, I wanna see the stars in your eyes,
Then make a little magic there in the moonlight, and top it off with a Texas sunrise.
So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.
So cast away all our cares in the world, like a worm on a hook on a cane pole line,
Let your hair down, kick your feet up let a country boy show you a real good time.


Don’t you know life is kinda crazy, what are the chances that I’d see you here.
I think about you round this time every year.
Racin down this Texas highway, chasing after dreams of love, I thought I had it all.
Dancing with you down at Gruene Hall. I smile when I think about
You and me in the cab of that ol pickup truck, our first kiss my foot slipped off the clutch,
bit my lip and laughed out loud and your still laughin now.
I loved you so much, both believing in promises we couldn’t keep.
Havin way too much fun and too little sleep.
Once upon a time you were my world, but you’ll always be my Summertime Girl. 
Our little town was lazy, there wasn’t much to do to pass the time, so we got bored and stole that county road sign.
Just like you did with my heart, you stole it away and tore it apart,
left it shot full of holes, girl I guess that’s the way it goes, Lord knows we had a good run
You and me in the cab of that ol pickup truck, our first kiss my foot slipped off the clutch,
bit my lip and laughed out loud and your still laughin now.
I loved you so much, both believing in promises we couldn’t keep.
Havin way too much fun and too little sleep.
Once upon a time you were my world, but you’ll always be my Summertime Girl. 
I thought my heart would stop, yeah I thought my life would end, when you said goodbye, to my surprise, the sun came up again.
And when those bluebonnets bloom, it reminds me of you down on that riverwalk.
On that forth of July let those fireworks fly. With willie and the boys, Down in Luckenbach 
You and me in the cab of that ol pickup truck, our first kiss my foot slipped off the clutch,
bit my lip and laughed out loud and your still laughin now.
I loved you so much, both believing in promises we couldn’t keep.
Havin way too much fun and too little sleep.
Once upon a time you were my world, but you’ll always be my Summertime Girl. 
You’ll always be my Summertime Girl.


Girl you don’t have to get dolled up, old T-shirt on you, will do just fine.
Besides, you know nothing stays on you too long, once you’re in these arms of mine.
And I’ve seen you pretty in pink, I’ve seen you beautiful in blue.
I have to say, I love the way my lips look on you. 
So lay back baby and close your eyes. Let me run my fingers through your hair,
Soft kisses down the side of your neck, and we both know where it goes from there.
Girl even after all these years, lovin you still feels brand new, I just have to say, I love the way my lips look on you. 
That cotton dress that you wore tonight looked amazing on you, and that’s for sure.
And not as good as it does right now, lyin there on our bedroom floor.
And I like the way I make you blush, I wanna take you where we’ve never been, I wanna whisper in your ear, I wanna taste your sweet skin
So lay back baby and close your eyes. Let me run my fingers through your hair,
Soft kisses down the side of your neck, and we both know where it goes from there.
Girl even after all these years, lovin you still feels brand new, I just have to say, I love the way my lips look on you. 
So lay back baby and close your eyes. Let me run my fingers through your hair,
Soft kisses down the side of your neck, and we both know where it goes from there.
Girl even after all these years, lovin you still feels brand new, I just have to say, I love the way my lips look on you. 
I just have to say, I love the way my lips look on you.


Young man on the side of the road. Lost and beat up with nowhere to go.
Smells like a hangover from days ago, but he does what he can to survive.
Single mom with a dead end job. 90 hour week just to keep what she’s got.
But the bills add up and now she’s caught. She does what she can to survive.
Well, let me say that love won’t take away the pain.
But don’t be afraid cause it will never walk away.
If your scared that you don’t matter.
If your lost and need to be found.
If your lookin’ for a savior.
All you gotta do is turn around.
Some turn to a bottle. Some turn to a drug.
Some turn to another’s arms, but it seems like it’s never enough.
Well, I won’t say that you will never fail again.
But, there is grace to wash away your every sin.
If your scared that you don’t matter.
If your lost and need to be found.
If your lookin’ for a savior.
All you gotta do is turn around.
All you gotta do is turn around.
Turn around.
You don’t have to take the broken road.
You can turn around and come back home. 
You don’t have to take the broken road.
You can turn around and come back home.
If your scared that you don’t matter.
If your lost and need to be found.
If your lookin’ for a savior.
All you gotta do is turn around.
No one listens to you anymore.
Any your heart has broken down.
You don’t need to move.
Love has come to you.
All you gotta do is turn around.
All you gotta do is turn around.


In the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
They had to carry away that brave young man
A little part of every heart of every rodeo fan
Died there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
Lookin' back it doesn't seem so long ago
He was bigger than life, God rest his soul
Why he died that day is hard to understand
Right there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne[Chorus:]
So tip your hat to the cowboy every once in a while
And take time to remember that cowboy's smile
A little part of every heart of every rodeo fan
Died there in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
No buckles on a shelf collecting dust
Still his memory shines inside of all of us
Some miss their hero, some miss their friend
His mom and daddy long to see their little boy again[Chorus]
In the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne
They had to carry away that brave young man
If your washed in the blood someday you'll see him again
And it won't be in the rain and the mud in July in Cheyenne


Hold tight with a leather fist. Watch out when he starts to twist.
It’s what the daddys used to tell them boys how to ride them bulls.
Got a jingle in my jeans, sore places in between.
And I’m leavin’ old Abilene with a push and a pull. 
10-4 buddy come on back. A horse trailer on a Cadillac.
Yeah we’re talking to the cowboy in the coupe deville. 
Chug-a-luggin’ up one side, slidin’ down the other.
Well, I’m a lover of the other side of the hill. 
Turn up that radio. Don’t wanna think about a rodeo.
Don’t wanna think about a round-up up ol’ Cheyenne.
‘Cause it’s a crazy circuit. Aww but still ya work it.
Turn down that sound boys let’s get up and check the scan. 
10-4 buddy come on back. A horse trailer on a Cadillac.
Yeah we’re talking to the cowboy in the coupe deville. 
Chug-a-luggin’ up one side, slidin’ down the other.
Hey, I’m a lover of the other side of the hill. 
Bandanna hangin’ on my mirror. Still wet from ear to ear.
Well, I guess its true then what the wise men say.
When you ride your last one, make sure he’s a fast one.
And jump while he’s movin’. Tip your hat boys and walk away.
10-4 buddy come on back. A horse trailer on a Cadillac.
Yeah we’re talking to the cowboy in the coupe deville. 
Chug-a-luggin’ up one side, slidin’ down the other.
Hey, I’m a lover of the other side of the hill. 
10-4 buddy come on back. A horse trailer on a Cadillac.
Yeah we’re talking to the cowboy in the coupe deville. 
Chug-a-luggin’ up one side, slidin’ down the other.
Hey, I’m a lover of the other side of the hill. 
Hey, I’m a lover of the other side of the hill.


He broke your heart,
And he tore your dreams in two.
And he kissed a bottom-feedin’ sucker-fish
In front of you.
Deep down you knew that it was never gonna last,
‘Cuz he’s a piece of stink-bait,
Always actin’ like a bass and,
Now you’re thinkin’
Your ship is slowly sinkin’.
You’re stayin’ up all night long,
Drownin’ in your drinkin’.
Before you give up,
Get your rear back in the water.
Dance a jig,
Jitterbug,
Or tie on a hula popper.
Then you throw out a line,
Reel it back in.
If you catch a boot,
You gotta cast it out again.
You know you’ll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
So get back in that boat and fish!
Now you heard the girl he’s kissin’
Is stirrin’ up a wake.
Sayin she hooked you good,
And threw you right back in the lake.
Just remember what your mama said,
About sticks and rocks.
Even though you’d like to smack her
With your metal tackle box,
You gotta throw out a line,
Reel it back in.
If you catch a boot,
You gotta cast it out again.
You know you’ll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
So get back in that boat and fish!
So don’t say farewell to forever,
Like happy ever after ain’t never gonna work.
Don’t you throw the towel in,
The last one you drug in
Was just a state record-breakin’
Large-mouth jerk.
You gotta throw out a line,
Reel it back in
If you catch a boot
You gotta cast it out again
You know you’ll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry
So get back in that boat and,
Throw out a line,
Reel it back in.
If you catch a boot,
You gotta cast it out again.
You know you’ll never catch a keeper
If you sit around and cry.
So get back in that boat and fish!
Yeah, get back in that boat and fish!
Girl, get back in that boat,
And fish!


I love so fragile
And the heart so hollow
Shatter with words
Impossible to follow
You’re saying I’m fragile
I try not to be
I search only
For something
I can’t see
I have my own life
And I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won’t be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won’t be walking out the door
Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I’d never want to leave
Sometimes I’m a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you light my nights
Somehow I’d get by
Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
Lovers forever
Face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me
My lace
Take from me
My lace
Take from me
My lace


There's a memory that rings clear as a bell,
I was bouncin like a bull rider on his knee,
I sure miss those old stories that he'd tell,
From a hobo on a freight train,
To a sailor out at sea,
My granny says that I've got his smile,
He's the reason I take pride in my last name,
No he never made the headlines,
Nobody sings his song,
So for every unsung hero I'm singin this today,[Chorus:]
So raise your bottle to the boys and let's remember,
All the fallen and the price they had to pay,
Hold 'em up high and salute all the ones that made it back,
And for the ones away from home, don't forget to pray,
Grandpa would sing you every hank williams song,
But it's amazing grace that brought him back around,
He'd shead a tear talkin about the day,
That german gunner shot his best friend down,
My daddy fought a war some say in vain,
He came home in a wheel chair, he walks with a kane,
Seems like every generation has to pay the cost,
I think about my family and the good friends that we've lost,[Chorus]
From Normandy to Korea, to Kason Vietnam,
Heartaches streach from coast to coast,
From Bunker Hill to Filucia, Gettysburg to Japan,
Everyone who's ever served or lost someone let's make a toast,[Chorus]


Now first of all I gotta warn you.
Before you fall in love with me. 
This here kickin’ out the footlights ain’t all its cracked up to be. 
Well, cheap hotels and truck stop coffee its what makes the wheels go round.
I know exactly what your thinkin’ girl.
God only knows if I’ll ever settle down.
So if you think you can take it.
And enjoy the nonsense and the noise. 
Girl it ain’t easy holdin’ on to hard livin’, honky tonkin, Texas boys.
Just ask the women who have been there.
Who’ve lived and breathed that crazy life.
Ask sweet Jessie about ol’ Wayland. 
Ask ol’ Willie’s four ex-wives.
Some day your gonna want a family.
Some day you may be wantin’ more.
In a king size bed that’s always lonely.
Whenever I walk out your door.
But if you think you can take it.
And enjoy the nonsense and the noise. 
Girl it ain’t easy holdin’ on to hard livin’, honky tonkin, Texas boys.
There’s something about them neon signs.
I’m like a moth drawn to a flame.
Blame it on a smoky bar or a cryin’ steel guitar.
Those pretty girls screamin’ my name.
So if you think you can take it.
And enjoy the nonsense and the noise. 
Girl it ain’t easy holdin’ on to hard livin’, honky tonkin, Texas boys.
Girl it ain’t easy holdin’ on to hard livin’, honky tonkin, Texas boys.


It’s finally here, todays the day, I had a 12 point buck 50 yards away.
But I got a different kinda huntin on my mind, I got my baby up in my deer blind. 
Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, girl you’re lookin fine,
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
I dreamed about it, waited all year, forgot it all when you whispered in my ear.
I’m lost for words, what can I say? I never knew they made Mossy Oak negligee
Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, girl you’re lookin fine,
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
Well, that old game warden, he better steer clear, there ain’t no poachin goin on up here.
Its warm and cozy, and the stars are bright above,
Don’t knock it till you try a little redneck love
Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, and girl you’re lookin fine, 
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
Country music on the radio, pull the real tree camouflage shades down low.
Life is good, girl you’re lookin fine,
Thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.
It’s finally here, todays the day, I had a 12 point buck 50 yards away.
But I got a different kinda huntin on my mind, thank God I got my baby up in my deer blind.


I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?
You know I got a jacked up pickup truck
with mud flaps and a 4-wheel drive.
I got it decked out like a Country pimp
I'll even let you twirl my fuzzy dice.
'Cause I'm a blue collar redneck
crazy white boy from the south
And if you see any folk got a problem with that
Sweet Potato Pie shut your mouth!
I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?
If you like Lynyrd Skynyrd on the radio
let me know and I'll sing you 'Free Bird'.
I like Johnny Cash Grand Master Flash
I'm name droppin' like you never heard.
I won't try it unless you fry it
put the Crisco in the pan.
I love fresh fried red hot hush puppies.
I got gravy running down my chin.
I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?
Now all these hot senoritas want to ride with me
I got 'em crawling up the side of my GMC.
Country Boys got my back,
Country Girls on my hook.
My 30-30 shined up and she lookin' good.
An' someone flyin' on my redneck roots,
knocking my gold belt buckle and my snake skin boots.
But I'm in it to win it so place your bets
and tell the whole world that I'm the Honky Tonk Kid.
I say 'Hey y'all, look at me!'
I'm the name of the game and they call me Country.
'Cause I can rattle that buck, hook a big cat.
My girl is skinny but my rhymes are phat.
I'm a gun-totin' big mouth bass boatin'
and my granny likes a chew and chaw.
I've been saved from sin, can I get an 'amen'
and then can I get a 'Hey, y'all!'?


Well God bless Texas
And Deakon Shackleford
He read the bible seven times
And he believed every word
That ol' beat up leather book had been through it all
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw
Singin'
"Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound"
That saved a wrech like me
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishin' after church 
And taught me things I needed to know
No, Deakon didn't have a family
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid[Chorus:]
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns 
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down the street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tatoo
He was on a ship off at sea when she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from the far side of the earth
He lost the will to love
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah life took him to hell and back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Singin'
"I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind
But now I see"[Chorus]
Before he went he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't I couldn't help but lie
Cause today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
And then the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down the street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showing off his brand spanking new wings
And his barbed wire halo
Sweet chariots coming forth to carry me home


I still think about us
In the rush that we felt
With the rag top down and the radio blasting
You were riding shot gun
In nothing but a bikini and a seat belt
Looking better than the law should have been allowing[Chorus:]
We hit the corners going 90
Lovin' blindly fallin' 
Head over heels over you
Every feeling that we felt
Was a feeling that felt brand new
And you looked just like an angel
With that cross on your necklace
You were young, I was wild, we were reckless
We'd drive on down to the river 
Burnin' up those hot summer nights
Laughin' at the cowboys getting crazy 
Pickin' fights
It wasn't funny
When that deputy, caught you and me
Steaming up those windows 
And how your daddy never found out about it
Honey, heaven only knows[Chorus]
I looked into your eyes and I 
Promised you forever
I believed it with all my heart 
I just didn't know any better
Gettin' over you took years
Aww despite those tears I cried
I'd do it all over again
All for the thrill of the ride[Chorus]
Young, wild, and reckless


I got a letter from your lawyer
And you got one from mine
They say it's gonna be final
Once we sign that dotted line
We'll I guess we'll get our freedom
And a so called fresh new start
But when you take half of everything
You'll be taking half my heart
Our love got lost somewhere in life's complications
Torn between two lawyers and all their legal litigations 
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
I took down our wedding picture 
From above the fireplace
And I stood there awhile
Starring at your pretty face
Have we lost our love
To differences we can't resolve
But if push comes to shove
Thank God no children are involved
I can still see you throwing your rose bouquet 
I never thought I'd see the day we'd throw it all away
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
I've done all I can do now all I can do is pray
And ask the Lord to let me hear you say
Off the record, there's something I need to say to you
This ain't easy but it's what my heart has to do
Cause I can't let you go until I let you know
Off the record, I'm still in love with you
Girl, off the record, I'm still in love with you


You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
For dancin' naked on New Year's Eve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I'll buy a one-way ticket to destination - you pick it
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Anytime you're nice, I can't help but think twice
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Aw yeah...


He's wrinkled and gray but he's still got the fire
And he sings on the stage like a bird on a wire
He'll pack 'em in just like he always did
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid
He got his first guitar when he was fifteen
Thirstin' for knowledge, all hungry and green
Strummin' that six string just like Lefty did
Everybody loves The Honky Tonk Kid[Chorus:]
Well the Honky Tonk Kid loves a honky tonk crowd
He picks them up when this world gets them down
All the smoke and the neon keep his pain here
Nobody knows The Honky Tonk Kid
Ten million fans and a hand full of friends
He'll go home alone when each night ends
He'll think about her and he'll twist off the lid
Cause nobody loves The Honky Tonk Kid[Chorus x2]
It won't be long the lord will take him away
He'd sung his last song, they'll place a reef on his grave
But he'll draw a crowd just like he always did
One last goodbye for The Honky Tonk Kid


My mountain is a mole hill
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turned to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
It's gonna buckle at the knee
Upon my castle made of sand
I cannot be the king of me
There's the man in white
His words are painted red
There's power in his blood
And only truth in what he said
There's the main in black
With a needle in his vein
Lying flat upon his back
This is the prayer that he once prayed
He said, my mountain is a mole hill
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turned to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
It's gonna buckle at the knee
On my castle made of sand
I cannot be the king of me
And this (?) in my heart
Is filled with pot metal and fool's gold
Once your statue turns to dirt
All that's left in the end is your soul
God save your soul
So he said, shout out of control
With all your heart and soul
Though this cold world may tear you apart
Let the whole world know
My mountain is a mole hill
My throne's a busted chair
This crown has turned to rust
And it's all tangled in my hair
This high horse that I ride on
It's gonna buckle at the knee
Upon my castle made of sand
I cannot be the king of me[x2]
Lord, I am just a man
I cannot be the king of me


River’s strong, you can’t swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon’s so bright you could drive with your headlight’s out
Cause a little bit of summer’s what the whole year’s all about
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain’t this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin’ on like a wildfire
Don’t get up just to get another you can drink from mine
We can’t leave each other
We can dance with the dead, you can rest your head on my shoulder,
If you wanna get older with me
Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain’t this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin’ on like a wildfire
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain’t this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin’ on like a wildfire
Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain’t this a blessed kind of day
You and me been catchin’ on like a wildfire
Ba-da-ba-da-da, Ba-da-ba-da-da, Ba-da-ba-da-da
Ba-da-ba-da-da, Ba-da-ba-da-da, Ba-da-ba-da-da
Ba-da-ba-da-da, Ba-da-ba-da-da, Ba-da-ba-da-da


I'm gonna give em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor, like an outlaws boys on the day
Before. got the pretty girls out there begging for more,
Gotta give em all what
They came here for. Doin' my thing singing my song,
Right on track I'm chugging
Along. I'm here and gone like yesterday,
Rolling like an old freight train. On a
Wing and a prayer and a glorified greyhound bus,
Flying down the road running
9-0 and kicking up dust. Drinkin' truck stop coffee
Countin' birds on those
Telephone wires. Burnin' the midnight oil
And the tread off these old goodyear
Tires. I'm gonna give em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor,
Like an outlaws boys on the day
Before. got the pretty girls out there begging for more,
Gotta give em all what they came here for.
Doin' my thing singing my song, right on track I'm chugging
Along. I'm here and gone like yesterday, rolling like an old freight train.
And sometimes my mind is a million miles away,
I know you're sound asleep at
Home while I'm on this stage. and I'm missing you
Wishing I was kissing you
Everyday. but girl I gotta keep rollin',
Rollin like an old freight train. and its a
Mighty lonesome sound when there's not soul around
To help you ease your pain,
But you gotta keep rollin'. Rollin' like an old freight train.
I'm gonna give em that
2, 4, 4 on the floor, like an outlaws boys on the day before.
Got the pretty
Girls out there begging for more,
Gotta give em all what they came here for.
Doin' my thing singing my song, right on track I'm chugging along.
I'm here and gone like yesterday, rolling like an old freight train,
Comin' on down the line
Feel that diesel engine whine, smell the smoke stack,
Hear the gears grind full steam ahead halfway out of my mind
I'm too far gone to be turning back
Going clickity clack down the railroad tracks.
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train. just like an old freight train.
Tell me do you wanna ride this train.


She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look
She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that
Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile
When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook

In another time and place
Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my Grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends
And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown
And they were gone
Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack like and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring.
There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday
So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink
'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the Spring
Life can be filled full of sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could the day
Like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring


He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does
Someone who knows the blessin' of a good hard rain
Somebody simple and strong that he knows he can count on
Soft as the wind, you're bold enough to bless his name
That's why God loves cowboys, I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tenden, the fences needs menden
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride to those broken harded honky tonk angles
Oooooh
That's why God loves cowboys
He knew they need room and freedom
So he gave em' Texas and those big Montana skies
He was there when he heard those prayers coming from shying
Right beside that young man on his last ride
That's why God loves cowboys, I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tenden and the fences needs menden
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride to those broken harded honky tonk angles
Ooooooh
That's why God loved cowboys
Ooh those cold nights get lonely
He needs more then just a good fire keeping him warm
Ooh there's nothing more holy
Than a love of a woman weather life storm
That's why God loves cowgirls, I believe there's a place in his heart
Cause when the herd needs tenden and the fences needs menden
He knows they'll work hard, on his great big ranch called life
Cause they love and take care of all it's creations
From the horses they ride to those broken harded honky tonk heros
Ooooooh
That's why God loves cowgirls
Ooooooh
That's why God loves cowboys


First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven
In the parking lot of that old 7/11
I filled up a truck,
I went in to pay when I walked out
she was with him smilin' as she drove away
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl,
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name,
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
If you play with fire you're bound to get burned
You would think by now that I would've learned
but she's lookin so hot, so what can I say
My mama said don't but I did it anywayyy
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl,
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name,
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
Awwh tug on them hard strings now
I wish you didn't look so dang good
I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way if there's any
It's a lot shinnin' brighter than the sun
like a sock from above tellin' me to run awayyy
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl,
It's gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name,
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
And like a tattoo on my heart I know she's gonna leave a mark.


don't you ever let this world push you around
use your head and keep your feet firmly on the ground
and if you get knocked down
get back up and try again
and don't you ever lose that sparkle in your eyes
don't bottle up your passion like a jar of fireflies
if you ever lose sight of your light
and you feel like givin' in
don't you forget your faith in God above
don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
when you fear, when you fail, when you feel you're gonna fall
follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
don't buy a thing unless you can pay in cash
go ahead and throw those credit cards in the trash
love is a virtue, honesty is the key
say your prayers, brush your teeth, don't you watch too much TV
if you're down in the count one strike away
choke up and crowd the plate and put the ball in play
keep your nose down when you win
keep your head up when you lose
and you're gonna lose
don't you forget your faith in God above
don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
when you fear, when you fail, when you feel you're gonna fall
follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
and there will come a day
when I will fly away
so make me smile while we're apart
you gotta sing from you soul and play with all of your heart
there's a good chance your heart will break in two
trust that God has someone special planned for you
did you know I was down on love and luck
when he sent your mom to me?
someday you'll have babies of your own
so cherish every moment, you're gonna blink and they'll be grown
the greatest honor that I've ever had
is having you call me your dad
boys don't forget your faith in God above
don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
when you fear, when you fail, when you feel you're gonna fall
follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
when you fear, when you fail, when you feel you're gonna fall
follow your heart and always believe in the underdog


Now there you go givin' that eye,
with your hand on my thigh,
you got me swervin' all over the place.
You got me wantin' and needin'
you're the reason for my speedin'
and you know you can't blame it on the breaks.
Blame it on those baby blues
for lookin' like you do
blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin'
blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
tailgate kind of summer night
blame it on you for lovin' me so true
girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch
blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
blame it on those baby blues
but you can't blame me for lovin' you.
Yeah when the sun goes down on the sleepy little town
you turn my world into a country love song.
Take a good long look in the mirror
Naw, it couldn't be any clearer
and you'll see what turns my radio on
Blame it on those baby blues
for lookin' like you do
blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin'
blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
tailgate kind of summer night
blame it on you for lovin' me so true
girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch
blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
blame it on those baby blues
but you can't blame me for lovin'
The way you love me
can't get enough of me
rain or shine, all the time, with all your heart and soul.
I'll be lookin' in your eyes
by the time the sunrise comes
shinin' through your bedroom window.
You can blame it on those baby blues
for lookin' like you do
blame it on your slow dancin', county road romancin'
blame it on the moonlight shinin' bright
tailgate kind of summer night
blame it on you for lovin' me so true
girl you can blame it on your smile, your whisper, and your touch
blame it on your lips for kissin' me so much
blame it on those baby blues
but you can't blame me for lovin' you.
No, no matter what you do,
girl you can't blame me for lovin' you.
You can blame it on those baby blues
for lookin like you do


I've had one of those days
Good for nothing kind of days
I've had hard luck, bad luck and no luck at all
Girl I need you to be my soft place to fall
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights
say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away
Far away
I've had one of those days
Before nothing kind of days
Baby I need one of your nights
I want to hold you tight
fine wine and candle lights
I've had red lights, bar fights
bright lights blinding me
Girl I need your touch to set me free
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights 
say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away
Far away
I've had one of those days
Before nothing kind of days
Baby I need one of your nights
Girl we got that kind of romance
One that will dance without even touching the ground
Remember that night on your street
I said I'd sweep you of your feet
Well forever is forever
And I'll never gonna let you down
Never ever gonna let you down
So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights
say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away
Far away
I've had one of those days
Before nothing kind of days
Baby I need one of your nights
one of your nights
I've had one of those days
good for nothing kind of days


Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory
The old tire swing where my little boys play
Well, that was me only yesterday
Doing double back flips off the branch in the tank
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank
We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Passed down from my granny and my grandpa
Mom and daddy kept it safe, kept it sturdy and tall
Summers were hot, winters were long
But our roots were deep and our faith was strong
Now some are gone, and some are all grown
You and me, baby, branched out on our own
With every sunset comes another sunrise
I can see my daddy in our little boys' eyes
We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Lost love once throughout the years
Remember their smiles and dry those tears
'Cause they'll live on in your heart and mine
So let love grow like a country vine
We've had some good times, got through the bad times
The sound of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of our family tree
Made in the shade of our family tree
Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
A family that prays together
Is a family that stays together
Love the Lord thy God and Savior
With all your heart and love thy neighbor[x2]


We pull into town, try to find the fairgrounds
Park this Cadillac out back, behind the loading chutes
Finally made the big show, traveling with the rodeo
I'm one of the boys that make sure nobody pays with their
Life ain't easy for a joker like me
I've got a smile painted on my face
It's only make believe
She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen
Every night the crowd goes wild when they see her riding
Shining like a diamond, she don't even know my name
I try to turn my feelings off before they load the roughstock
Gotta get my stuff together, take a shot and forget
How much time stands still when the bull starts spinning
When the bull starts spinning
When the bull starts spinning
She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen
And [?]
I might work up the nerve to tell her right
I ain't just some fool in a barrel no
There's a real heart beating underneath my
Over-sized wranglers, yellow suspenders
I might look like it but I ain't a pretender
No no
I gotta tell her, gotta tell her
Gotta tell her that
She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they cover the gate
I'm afraid someone's gonna get hurt
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen


Now this is a true story for the most part
That occurred on the top floor of this bigwig record executive's office in Nashville, Tennessee
Now understand I'm not poking any fun or disrespecting anybody
God knows I love country music with all my heart and soul
And I love the Grand Ole Opry
But I do have a problem with someone who can't even play a D chord on a guitar
Telling someone with a dream that they won't get far
So this song is dedicated to all those underdogs like me out there running around
Don't get discouraged if you have a dream
Don't be afraid to chase it down
It's how it goes
He said, "Son, don't get offended by what I'm about to say
I can see you have a passion
For the songs you write and play
But you lack what we all call commercial appeal
And you just don't have what it takes
To make it here in Nashville"
Ouch...
Well my heart felt like a train wreck
But I wore a smile on my face
I said, "Thank you for your time, sir"
Put my guitar back in its case
Our little conversation was like a revelation
Redirecting my dreams
'Cause God knows I'd never sell my soul to rock 'n' roll or rap
Or wear those tight skinny jeans
Cause you know I'd rather sing my own songs
Than be a puppet on a string
I'll wear what I want to wear
I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need
Is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas
Than the king of Tennessee
So I loaded up my old pickup truck
And I drove back home to Amarillo
Got a gig off old route 66
At this ballroom called "The Armadillo"
And for the first thousand shows or so
Not a soul showed up
I thought about quitting every other day
But I just kept on kicking that cup
Yeah, I kept kicking that can surrounded by blood, sweat, and beers
And wouldn't you know I became an overnight sensation
In just over ten years
And now I'm packing out all the dance halls
And the rodeos every night
I got a pretty wife, a ranch, a band, a bus, a boat
I'd say I'm doing alright
And you know I'd rather sing my own songs
Than be a puppet on a string
I'll wear what I want to wear
I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need
Is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas
Than the king of Tennessee
Oh, how 'bout a little front porch picking, boys
Well, wouldn't you know that old record man
Showed up one night at this honky tonking bar
After my show he said, "Son, I believe you might be the next big country star"
He said, "We like how you keep it raw
We like how you keeping it real
And I think you may just have what we all like to call commercial appeal"
Huh, ain't that something
Well, sir...
I'd rather sing my own songs
Than be a puppet on a string
I'll wear what I want to wear
And I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing
Heaven knows all I need
Is my faith, my fans, my friends and my family
Besides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas
Than the king of Tennessee
God bless Tennessee
But I'd rather be just an old fence post in Texas
Than sell my soul to rock 'n' roll or rap
Or wear those tight fitting skinny jeans


Here we go....
You're too hard to handle
Scandal after scandal
You must think I'm naive
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
It's wild alibis and those outrageous lies
You expect me to believe
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Measure what we have between the good and the bad
And there's just too much uncertainty
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Because you placed the blame on the pink champagne
For dancin' naked on New Year's Eve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I'll buy a one-way ticket to destination - you pick it
Anywhere from Tulsa to Tel Aviv
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Well, I've thought about it and I've made up my mind
It's time we call it quits
You know you may be fun for Saturday night
But the rest of the week is the pits
Anytime you're nice, I can't help but think twice
There's always something up your sleeve
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
I don't want you to go
But I need you to leave
Aw yeah....


Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely,
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Don't leave me I cry, don't take that airplane ride.
But you locked me out of your mind.
Left me standing here behind.
Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight,
They're taking you away. Leaving me lonely.
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Slowly fading out of sight.


They say he came out singing the moment he was born
And he could pick that old flat top guitar like a farmer pickin' corn
And he'd sneak in those old honky tonks until they'd kick him out
And his daddy wonder how he learned all the stuff he sang about[CHORUS:]
He sang songs about dogs, songs about drinking
Songs about mamas and trains
Songs about heart broke country boys 
Standin' out in the rain
Songs about dancehall beauty queens worth getting into a fight
Songs about nothing better to do, songs about Saturday night
When he turned eighteen he went off to the war
His sweetheart wrote him letters she said she'd wait for sure
By the time he came back home she was nowhere to be found
So he packed his bags hit them honky tonks from town to town[CHORUS]
Well everywhere he went, everybody knew his name
But he never got the big hit, he stayed just the same
And he moved back to the country when it was time to call it quits
Now if you want to hear his music, you have to buy his greatest hits


Thanks, thanks a lot
I got a broken heard that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
I lost your love, honey, thanks a lot.
You told our friends I was passing by
That you're not sorry that you made me cry
You said I deserved just what I got
Well, if that's how you feel, honey, thanks a lot.
Thanks, thanks a lot
I got a broken heard that's all I got
You made me cry and I cried a lot
I lost your love, honey, thanks a lot.
You wanted a fool, and I played the part
Now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little and you laughed a lot
Then you were gone, honey, thanks a lot.


Take one last breath
You're about to jump to your death [x2]
Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heavens door. [x2]
Captain Captain
Before the sail rips [x3]
Gasp for air
ABANDON ALL SHIPS!!!
The current's strong,
the waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding me down.
I'm on a cruise to Paradise.
I'm done with sin I've paid my price.
God is our captain,
change your direction
Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt. [x2]
Look what we've built, walking blindfolded.
Look what we've built, walking on the plank of guilt. [x3]
Who parts the sea?
Choose your side.
So come with me.
You decide. [x2]


Come on!
Come on!
The night is young,
Can you feel the heat?
We got nothing to loose.
(We got nothing to loose.)
This is all we do,
Now can you feel the beat?
It's a party.
(Its a party.)
So leave your problems at the door.
If you come then you better have them no more.
So leave your problems at the door.
If you come then you better have them no more.
So leave your problems at the door.
If you come then you better have them no more.
So leave your problems at the door.
Come on!
Come on!
Lets go!
We never thought that it would come to this.
We never thought that it would come.
We never thought that it would come to this.
We never thought that it would come to this.


Even if it rains, and the sun won't shine, sun won't shine.
Whatever the weather you'll be mine.
All of this noise!
Distracts me!
Fear him now!
Let there be light!
Through the worst weather.
I'll make sure we're together.
When the sky begins to hail,
We will prevail.
WE WILL PREVAIL!
The beauty in the eye of the storm!
Is where I stand when I feel your grace!
I forget about my pride and my place!
Just take me from here!
When... the sky turns grey...
I'll pray for, a better day.
A better day.
Let's watch the rain fall,
And wash away our innocence.
In the clouds I hear the chorus sing.
Hallelujah...
Put the south in your mouth and swallow.
We are the heard and he is our shepherd.
We are the heard and he is our shepherd.
He whose without sin cast the first stone!
But, who are you to judge?!
Who are you to judge!?


Help me, I can’t get out,
I live my life not knowing what it’s about,
Just stains of guilt on my mind;
Heaven’s what I want to find.
This is now, that was then:
I want to be born again.
(Oh!)
The darkness came, 
The light fought through, 
Mercy is all
I ask of you. [x2]
Father, Father, please set me free,
From my misery. [x2]
I will be with you…
In the beginning, I used to believe
That you were no saviour, but I was naïve.
You were a stranger that I couldn’t see.
Now I’m in danger; please set me free.
Even soft…
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
Pray for us, sinners now,
And at the hour of our death,
Save us.
Where would I be, 
Without you standing next to me?
I am the lock and you are the key
Release me from my,
Release me from my
Insanity.


You thought you had me fooled.
But you have no clue what's in store for you.
Sleepless nights and dreaming of you when dreams become nightmares.
So blame me for what I'll do.
What I'll do.
Fuck.
You've fallen victim to, the lie and it's just me and you.
You've fallen victim to the lie, but now it's just me and you.
And now it's just me and you.
One.
This could all be solved with a gun.
Two.
If this is true then it's too bad for you.
Three.
For everything you've done for me.
Four.
You'll burn in hell, you fucking whore.
Ow.
Baby, don't cry, don't scream.
Just close your eyes and pretend that this is a dream.
True... pretend that this is a dream.
It's all a dream.
Baby, don't cry, don't scream.
Just close your eyes and pretend that this is a dream.
Pretend that this is a dream.


You are nothing but a false prophet
A sworn enemy from the day we met
Head held up higher than your eyes could see
Your source of greed lacks divinity
For all that is and whatever will be
May you all die in your animosity
Doesn't matter what is written
Life will pass you by
Cause a book full of stories
Means nothing when you die
To believe is naive
His words may deceive
To believe is naive
Fuck you I geeve
Take a chance
Don't look back
Take a chance
Don't look back
Cause time is running out
I'm in a trance
With things I lack
But don't have any doubt
Take your chance
I am your God
Not your friend
He is a fraud
Embrace the end
You are nothing
But a false prophet


Let me explain 
Cause it drives me insane. 
Just to know you are there 
Seems like you don't care 
Another ending the same. 
Fuck you and everyone and everything. 
Cause we all know whose king, 
When I'm still standing in the ring. 
It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, 
It's those games you played, wish you would've stayed. 
It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away
In a dream she came to me (she came to me)
Blinded by the light (light) 
Put up a fight (put up a fight)
I couldn't see, couldn't see
I never knew this was a war. 
Lost count at you're a whore. 
Karma's fair but instead 
I'd rather see you dead. 
It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, 
It's those games you played, wish you would've stayed. 
It's so hard to say, couldn't run away, run away
In a dream she came to me (she came to me)
Blinded by the light (light) 
Put up a fight (put up a fight)
I couldn't see, couldn't see
I would walk through fire just to be with you. 
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do. 
Run away.
In a dream she came to me (she came to me)
Blinded by the light (light) 
Put up a fight (put up a fight)
I couldn't see, couldn't see
We don't give a fuck we just came to party. 
I don't give a fuck I just came to party. 
Wish you would have stayed. 
Stay with me.

In the clouds I hear the chorus sing.
Hallelujah...
I'm tired of this
The walls are closing in on me
I need an escape (I need an escape)
Don't stand in my way (Don't stand in my way)
Through the worst weather.
I'll make sure we're together.
When the sky begins to hail,
We will prevail.

Stay awake, and look into our future
Just breathe my name and let the music come alive.
We get into shkraps wherever we go.
Hold onto to your girls before we grab them bro.
We party it up till last call.
We don't give a fuck we came to brawl.
All I do is party.
Feel up your body.
Fist pump like Pauly D.
We're growing up gotti.
She's looking so hot.
Gotta get her some shots.
Bring her back to my spot.
Show her what I got.
All I do is party.
Feel up your body.
Fist pump like Pauly D.
We're growing up gotti.
Dance like you fuck.
Strange love.


Do you ever go home to a place where you don't belong.
Where the feeling of neglect can be oh so strong.
Where everything you try to say or do is always fucking wrong.
When everything around you is a sad, sad, sad song.
I did not choose to be here.
I know I'm your regret.
But I'll paint your blackened walls clear.
So you'll never forget.
So dance with me on these broken dreams.
If only, if only these walls could scream.
I did not choose to be here.
I know I'm your regret.
But I'll paint your blackened walls clear.
So you'll never forget.
Forget the broken promises this is now our fate.
Not knowing why they're given power to create.
When broken is the only word in which you can relate.
When everything you love became the only thing you hate.
So come on, come on and dance with me on these broken dreams
If only these walls could scream.
I did not choose to be here.
I know I'm your regret.
But I'll paint your blackened walls clear.
So you'll never forget.
I wanna see you all burn.


I'll be there watching from way up high
The shadow you can't see when the suns in the sky
Wondering eyes have no disguise
It's obvious that this love never dies
Never dies...
I'll be your guardian angel,
Your sweet company,
No matter where I go,
I'll make sure you're all I see [x2]
I'll be your guardian angel (guardian angel)
Guardian angel (guardian angel) [x2]
Watching over you (watching over you)
When you thought that you were alone,
You turned your back on me.
It's cause you think you sit high on a throne
I'll always have you on your knees.
I'll be your guardian angel,
Your sweet company,
No matter where I go,
I'll make sure you're all I see
I'll be your guardian angel, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
Your sweet company, (I can't get them off, get them off of you)
No matter where I go, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
I'll make sure you're all I see (I can't get them off of you)
I pray you'll be watching from way up high,
The shadow I can't see when the sun's in the sky (watching over you)
She felt a sense of fear as I came near,
And on my face, I drew a tear.
(She felt a sense of fear)
I'll be your guardian angel,
Your sweet company,
No matter where I go,
I'll make sure you're all I see
I'll be your guardian angel, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
Your sweet company, (I can't get them off, get them off of you)
No matter where I go, (My eyes are glued, I don't mean to intrude)
I'll make sure you're all I see (I can't get them off of you)
I'll be there watching from way up high
The shadow you can't see when the suns in the sky


Help me, I can't get out,
And I live my life not knowing what it's about,
Just stains of guilt on my mind;
Heaven's what I want to find.
This is now, that was then:
I want to be born again.
(Oh!)
The darkness came, 
The light fought through, 
Mercy is all
I ask of you.

Father, Father, 
please set me free,
From my misery.
Father, Father,

From my misery.
I will be with you
In the beginning, I used to believe
That you were no saviour, but I was naive.
You were a stranger that I couldn't see.
Now I'm in danger; please set me free.
Resurrected
We've been told
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
Pray for us, sinners now,
And at the hour of our death,
Save us.
Where would I be, 
Without you standing next to me?
I am the lock and you are the key
Release me from my,
Release me from my
Insanity.


I should have known, 
That your wings were sewn. 
Fell down from his throne. 
Sins heavy as stone. 
You'll die alone (you'll die alone) 
You'll die alone (you'll die alone)
I should have known, 
That your wings were sewn. 
I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
Call me insane, but my life or yours. 
I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
But my life or yours, I'd rather fucking die. 
I know you meant well 
But your love is not kind. 
I bet burning in hell 
Was not on your mind. 
Fly with me, to the place where angels go. 
To the place where angels go. 
The place where angels go. 
I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
Call me insane, but my life or yours. 
I'll break from the chains, come down from the sky. 
But my life or yours, I'd rather fucking die. 
I'd rather spend an eternity in hell, 
Than go to heaven without you (without you). 
I should have known, that your wings were sewn. 
Fell down from his throne. Sins heavy as stone, you'll die alone. 
I should have known, that your wings were sewn. 
(i should have known)
Fell down from his throne. Sins heavy as stone, you'll die alone. 
(i should have known)
To the place where angels go.
To the place where angels go.


Take one last breath
You're about to jump to your death
You're about to jump to your death
Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heavens door.
Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heavens door.
Captain, Captain
Before the sail rips
Captain Captain
I can see enemy ships
Captain Captain
Before the sail rips
Gasp for air
ABANDON ALL SHIPS!
The currents strong,
The waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding you down.
I'm on a cruise to Paradise.
I'm done with sin I've paid my price.
God is your captain,
Change your direction
Abandon All Ships...
We'll part the sea.
Choose your side.
Don't come with me.
You decide.
We'll Part the sea.
Don't come with me.
Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heavens door.
Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt.
Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt.
Look what we've built, walking blindfolded.
Look what we've built, blindfolded walking the plank of guilt.
Look what we've built...
The currents strong,
The waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding you down.
I'm on a cruise to Paradise.
I'm done with sin I've paid my price.
God is your captain,
Change your direction
Abandon all ships...


Good old friend
It's been too long
My broken heart you mend
How they were so wrong
Your bad reputation
Is nothing more than motivation
They think they know you but they don't know shit about it
They think I need you, but I use you, I don't need shit.
I'd rather walk with you in the darkness of the night,
Than walk alone with no one lit up by the light
I wanna feel you when there's nothing left inside
Fuck whatever they say girl, this moment feels so right.
I'd rather walk with you in the darkness of the night,
Than walk alone with no one lit up by the light
I wanna feel you when there's nothing left inside (the night [x4])
Fuck whatever they say girl, this moment feels so right.
Fuck whatever they say girl fuck fuck whatever they say girl
I'd rather walk with you in the darkness of the night (the night [x4])
Fuck whatever they say girl, this moment feels so right.
Fuck whatever they say girl fuck fuck whatever they say girl
I'm not afraid of the comedown [x3]
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid of the comedown [x3]
I'm not afraid.
You can't buy love but bitch, you'll love this shit
I'm so high up, fuck you.
I'll never quit.


Born and raised original,
You're just TV typical.
You think I'm just a gimmick?
From east to west you pussies mimic.
Right now's our time, and all I fucking know,
Is this city, throw it up,
Toronto.[Chorus:]
Blinding lights, where I go.
I look down from the top and it's crowded,
Below.
Rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I'm not.
Fuck yeah, I have an ego, but you would too.
If you had what I got,
But we embrace, all of this hate.
Bitch you're 15 minutes late.
Right now's our time, and all I fucking know,
Is this city, throw it up,
Toronto.[Chorus:]
Blinding lights, where I go.
I look down from the top and it's crowded,
Below.[Repeat][A-Game:]
They only see us when they look up.
It's kinda lonely where we've been standing.
But we got perfect view that's HD, wait 7D, Canon.
That's flashing lights in my past life.
Pilot mode about to take flight.
Paparazzi where we go, cool boyz you can blame it on my ego.
She say I got her wetter then Nemo.
I work for everything I need so,
I need more, a bad bitch, brains with a 4. average
They will see us when they look up.
And you know we killing this shit,
And you know we about to take over,
I advise you Abandon All Ships.[Chorus:]
Blinding lights, where I go.
I look down from the top and it's crowded,
Below.[Repeat]
If you don't like us, fuck you.
Forever Lonley Crew.
FLC ain't running.
UO is rising.
You're with us, or against us.
AAS is coming.
New York's running.
LA's running.
Yeah, you should be fucking scared.
Toronto's coming.


[x2:]
You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you.
When will we be together?
Attention seeker
You're a firm believer
In more then one
Pray the right will come
Close your eyes
Say your goodbyes
To real love
He's not that one you're dreaming of
Well, I hate to break it to you
You're just some fucking slut
Close your eyes
Say your goodbyes
Your negatives exposed, the pictures they stay the same
So hold your head down low, you're the only one to blame.
Bitch they're laughing at you
They don't hear your prayers
You think they're smiling at you?
They don't see you there
Attraction fades from the love you seek
Attention aids your failed technique
Close your eyes
Say your good byes.
Your negatives exposed, the pictures they stay the same
So hold your head down low, you're the only one to blame.
You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you?
When will we be together?
You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you?
I pray we end up together[x2:]
Your negatives exposed, the pictures they stay the same
So hold your head down low, you're the only one to blame.
You don't hear my prayers do you?
When will we be together?
You don't know that I love you.
I pray we end up together


I fear the struggle
I fear the strife
A fear of death
A fear of life
I fear for you
You fear for me
I fear for what
Will come to be
(Come to be [x4])
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine[x2]
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine
I got a feeling
I'm just scared
I'll start believing
When I see you there
Life's a portion
When you die it's done
Pretend your something
Not fooling anyone.
(Anyone [x4])
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine[x2:]
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine
(Am I alone)[x2:]
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine


We have created
The humanity destroyer
All we have hated
Kill the employer
A product of the 21st century
I am alone
Burning in the infirmary
This is my home
The American dream
Will die in a waiting room
We need a resolution
Save our fucking souls
An honest contribution
To dig out of these holes
A product of the 21st century
I am alone
Burning in the infirmary
This is my home
I will not die in a waiting room
the American dream
a product of the 21st century
will die in a waiting room


You paid attention
Was it time well spent?
Lies in the past, got dragged by the current.
How can you base what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august
It's mist fills my lungs,
Save me while I'm still young
We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
I tried to drown the pain away
But my pain learned how to swim
I think about it everyday
I'm what she wants but she needs him
How can you base what was a lie on trust
Strangers now, lovers in august
It's mist fills my lungs
Save me while I'm still young
We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
Save me while I'm still young [x2]
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean
Hoping they get back to you
We're lost with the love we once knew
I spilled my thoughts into the ocean [x2]
Save me while I'm still young


Turn me up up up when you're feeling low
Put on your headphones
(When you're feeling low)
(Stuck on repeatpeatpeat, I'll never go)
Eventually, you're gonna have to find the hands you trust holding
Honestly, I think she's bluffing so my hand's not folding
We're playing games she's pulling every card
I got something when it gets too hard.[x2:]
Turn me up (up up) when you're feeling low
Stuck on repeat (peat-peat), I'll never go
When you feel alone, put on your headphones
Maybe if we drink too much
Baby we won't think as much
Lately it must get lonely saying we're just friends
Baby don't tap out fight it till it ends
Were playing games, she's putting up her guard
I got something when it gets too hard.[x2]
Turn me up (up up) when you're feeling low
Stuck on repeat (peat-peat), I'll never go
When you feel alone, put on your headphones[x2:]
Turn me up (up up) when you're feeling low
Stuck on repeat (peat-peat), I'll never go
Put on your headphones[x2:]
I saw diamonds in her eyes
Oh, I've already tried
The noose around your neck
Will get tighter with every lie.


Fuck that when I die I'd rather go to hell
I speak the fucking truth
It aint hard to fucking tell
I'd tattoo it on my fucking face
Fuck you, I'll never fucking change.
And if I lose all my friends
I'll lift that fucking bottle
And drink it til it ends
You think I'm not that serious
So sit here and pretend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
When you've come to the end of the road
And all your stories have been told
21 let me show you what I've done
Your losing battle I've already won
Our wounds become undone
Discover hearts made of gold
21 let me show you what I've done
Your losing battle
I've just begun
I looked into my future
Was blinded by the light
On the path now
Doesn't matter left or right
Never had to choose
Never said I might
Might be fucking short
Never intimidated by height
Baby leave those heels on
I'm almost at the top
Not my fucking peak
So I'm never gonna stop
But maybe I'm too high
Maybe it's the pills I popped
I might fucking die
When I fucking drop.
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Fuck that when I die I'd rather go to hell
I speak the fucking truth
It's not hard to fucking tell
I'd tattoo it, tattoo it on my fucking face
Fuck you, Fuck you, I'll never fucking change.
And if I lose all my friends
I'll lift that fucking bottle
And drink until it ends
You think I'm not that serious
So sit here and pretend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
Not afraid to die
But my life I will defend
When you've come to the end of the road
And all your stories have been told
21 let me show you what I've done
You're losing battle I've already won
Our wounds become undone
Discover hearts made of gold
21 let me show you what I've done
Your losing battle
I've just begun


In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter
I refuse to just exist
In the end we will be missed
I refuse to just exist
In the end we must resist
I will never shatter
Nothing really matters
In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter
I believe in just myself
In the end there's no one else
I believe in just myself
There's no one else
I will never shatter
Nothing really matters
In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter
In the end none of this will matter
In the end we all will shatter
In the end only us will matter
In the end I will never shatter
(I refuse to just exist)


Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Brothers for life.
I live my life free of command
These are my friends
It's all I really have
Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Brothers for life.
I never wanted it to be this easy
I never had to try
Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Fuck that,
you're my brothers for life.
We die together
In numbers we stand
These are my brothers
They're all I really have
Born to die, we die together
In numbers we stand
These are my friends
They're all I really have.
I never wanted it to be this easy
I never had to try
Friends for seasons
Friends for reasons
Fuck that,
You're my brothers for life.


Your life is a lie
everything they told you
open your eyes
look at your life
you're just waiting to die
you're fucking meaningless
you lost your soul
the path you're on is not your own
you're living a lie
with the devil on my shoulder
and God as my witness
I am sorry for all my sins
too bad karma has no forgiveness
karma is a bitch
and it is coming to collect
save your fucking souls
there is no time to repent
i've never felt more alone
i made peace with my demons
who call me their home
pray for release
i know it haunts you inside
free me from the voices that trap me in my mind
with the devil on my shoulder
and God as my witness
I am sorry for all my sins
too bad karma has no forgiveness
if the path you're on is not your own
remember not to go down it alone
you're living a lie
with the devil on my shoulder
and God as my witness
I am sorry for all my sins
too bad karma has no forgiveness


The holy water that you soak in is poison
Save yourself from all the lies that you drowned in
Pay us for your petty redemption
Paradise it comes at cost
Born free in a world of condition
My faith in humanity lost
I sit alone and wonder why
Where do we go after we die
Where the hell would we be
If we didn't truly believe that
Heaven is a place on earth
My body was a temple that I choose to destroy
Waiting on a savoir a plastic decoy
Twenty four seven three sixty five
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
This house is haunted
I hear the sound
Of my faith being taunted
By souls that are bound to all the unwanted
Faceless people around, faithless people around
I sit alone and wonder why
Where do we go after we die
Heaven, heaven is a place on earth
Where the hell would we be
If we didn't truly believe that
Heaven is a place on earth


Hell exists believe it or not
I made a deal with the devil 
and now he's stuck in my thoughts but
Little does he know
I have no fucking soul
You fuel the fire that burns me alive
Locked in a gaze of every eye
Of enemies that came in disguise
I hope you bite your tongue on every lie
I do know one thing though
The devils good to know
Bitches they come and go
But I'll never sink that low
I'll tell you one thing though
They try and take your soul
You'll be the first to know
I'll never let you go
We are who we are
It's my life
I'm praying for a change
I know I've made my mistakes
I need to escape
From this hell that I create
Broken promises
Cut like glass on the floor
But bleeding out your sins will never
Settle the score
Inked in blood you'll see
You can't trust a mother fucker like me
You want to escape every one of your dreams
Trapped in a cage permanently
Your mind is a prison missing a key
Choke on your lies like
Anxiety
It's my life
I'm praying for a change
I know I've made my mistakes
I need to escape
From this hell that I create
I have no soul
I feel so damn alone
I have no fucking soul
I feel so damn alone


Welcome to the end
Honest enemies and fake friends
Unbreakable bounds now bend
Pointless to make amends
So I'll just pretend
I see your true colours
I see them shining through
I see your true colours
Now you painted my world blue
Shut the fuck up
Taste the words before you spit them out
Talk shit mother fucker you don't know what I'm about
Shut the fuck up
You're like the air
Sometime you're silent but you're always there
Fire from the spark
Like a shadow you follow but gone in the dark
I see your true colours
I see them shining through
I see your true colours
Now you painted my world blue
Shut the fuck up


Love was meant to be durable
But now my broken heart's incurable
To her I feel so invincible
I need a miracle
Walk away and know you're never alone
Your lips speak the words to my heart are unknown
You think you own me step down from your throne
Is this how it ends? Your true colours have shown
I search for the good in your lies
How can I compromise
The feelings I keep down inside
And I don't know why
I feel so alive
I made up my mind
It's time
This is goodbye
Love was meant to be durable
And I don't know why
I feel so alive
This is goodbye
Love was meant to be durable
But now my broken hearts incurable
To her I feel so invincible
I need a miracle


With the sun in my face and my head held high
I put my hands in the air to try and touch the sky
Take a deep breath and close my eyes
I spread my wings and I learn how to fly
I am alive


There is a stairway to heaven and highway to hell
Do you know where you're going? It's not hard to fucking tell
So, don't question my direction you'll understand
When we get there
What's right and what's wrong? Live your life like you don't care
There are two paths we can live by
But in the end we all fucking die
There's nothing in the world I'd rather do
Cause all my friends will be there too
When you're lost and you lose your way
I'll be right behind you
When you're down and you can't be saved
I'll get you right back on your feet
I will be the one to guide you home
When you're all alone and
When you're lost and you lose your way
When the easy way out
Seems like the only route
Asking leads doubt
What is life about?
To be silent or to shout
We go through obstacles that make choosing seem impossible
Don't forget where you end up is optional
There's nothing in the world I'd rather do
Cause all my friends will be there too
When you're lost and you lose your way
I'll be right behind you
When you're down and you can't be saved
I'll get you right back on your feet
I will be the one to guide you home
When you're all alone and
When you're lost and lose your way


Their intentions come through their eyes
Not through fake smiles not through tire lies
A picture they kept safely in memory
They plague you with a jealous disease
I look around and all I see
Are evil eyes surrounding me
I am alone, no one to confide
Choose your side
Look around and what do you see
Look around look around now baby
Is this where you want to be
I look around and all I see
Are evil eyes surrounding me
I am alone no one on my side
There's no one out there in whom I can confide
Jealous tongues store you with hate
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
They either want to kiss you kill you or be you
If only they knew the struggle I've been through
Confusing what they want with what they need
Another reason to justify greed
Look around and what do you see
Look around look around now baby
Is this where you want to be
I look around and all I see
Are evil eyes surrounding me
I am alone no one on my side
There's no one out there in whom I can confide
I hope you burn in hell
I fucking hate you
Don't think I don't see through you
Fuck you
Look around what do you see if this where you want to be


Baby where you going please come back
Please come back
You got so much love to give
I want that, I want that
Just take my hand and I promise that you're mine
Its just us two until the end of time
Love is a quote
Fame over friends
And what's the point of trying
If everything's a trend
The only thing that lasts is the ink on your skin
What happened to being different we only follow what's in
I try and tell myself it's all in my head
But why think twice if I'm already dead
Baby where you going please come back
Please come back
You got so much love to give
I want that, I want that
Just take my hand and I promise that you're mine
Its just us two until the end of time
Mind over matter over thinking is dangerous
Images will shatter what people think of us
I have my doubts but what the fuck is right
I'm staring down a tunnel expecting a light
I try and tell myself its all in my head
But why think twice if I'm already dead
Burn this bitch down
Fuck this bitch up
Tear the walls
Burn this bitch down
Baby where you going please come back
Please come back
You got so much love to give
I want that, I want that
Just take my hand and I promise that you're mine
Its just us two until the end of time


Close your eyes
We're suspended in time
Open up the sky and let me rise, you are mine
Give me a sign
Make the stars align
Let them shine
There's a paradise for me and you
My paradise is built for two
It's hard to find where does it hide
All along it was by my side
Cause paradise is everywhere
Take my hand it's yours to hold
Take my heart it's made of gold
Where do I start?
Are you sent from above
Set fire to my heart
I want to burn in your love
Let me feel the winter turn to spring
Lift my body up I want to feel your love again
Close your eyes
Were suspended in time
Open up the sky and let me rise, you are mine
Give me a sign
Make the star align
Let them shine
The wind won't guide you
To your distinction
You'll never follow through
Sin is your only salvation
There's a paradise for me and you
My paradise is built for two
Its hard to find where does it hide
All along it was by my side
Cause paradise is everywhere
Take my hand it's yours to hold
Take my heart it's made of gold


Do Dah Do Dah Dah Do Do Do [x2]
Do Dah Do Dah Dah Do Do Do [x8]
Maria, Maria, we like it loud [x4]
Maria, Maria, we like it fucking loud.
Maria, believe me, I like it loud.
Come on and sing with me.[x2]


I could use
A shot
Your novacaine
My soul's a fuse
Blows away your name
Then you can be the remedy
And I can be the enemy
And he can go and live as nothing
They you can be the wanna be
And I can be the remedy
And he can go to hell for all I care
Say this world is not so shallow
When you can't beg steal or borrow
Save your breath your soul is hollow
And it's all too much to swallow
Take this souvenir
They can't deny you were here
This scar always there
To medicate your fear


I'm outta sight around the moon
But I'll be back in time for you
I know it's strange but are you big enough?
Ok, you know this isn't right
I'm the bark that's to your bite
But I can't wait till you see the light
So I, I do it all for you
But I'm not asking for
You lead me on
I don't need your mercy kiss
I'm in and out of astral planes
The sliding doors I break the panes
I know it's strange so are you brave enough
Alright, like a quarterback I score
I'm the one they all adore
But I can't find what I'm looking for
I don't need your
I don't need it
I don't need your mercy kiss


What a mess our lives turned out to be
It was at its best when you and I were only 3
We can start with all the things that turn us out
And we can go right down the list and throw them out
Can we start over?
It's over
Here you are and there's where you wanna be
But don't think you don't have company
Think of all the lonely people in the world
And if it's God who made us why we so damn cruel
We can never lie
And you can never steal the time
And we can only watch them die
And we can never find out why


Everyone's a genius
Brushing up on irony
But no, no one's free
Everyone's a salesman
Gushing with sincerity
Or so, so it seems
I wanna go another round
I wanna blow the monster down
I wanna go another round
Cos I am coming up
I am coming back
Everyone's a rockstar
Look how cool and dark you are
Oh, what's become of me now?
We'll bust out the mission
We'll bust the holier than thee
OK Then we'll be free
I wanna go another round
I wanna blow the monster down
I wanna go another round
Cos I am coming up
I am coming back
Lay me on the table operate on me
Spin me like a record scratch the needle back and forth
I wanna go another round
I wanna blow the monster down
I wanna go another round
Cos I am coming up
I am coming back


I see the happy the family tree
It sways so easily
We're smiling all the time
This world just isn't mine
We watch it burn
And we never learn
This can't be what you're waiting for
Staring into the sun
We eat our young
This can't be what you're waiting for
Just take it easy on yourself
Forget all the stupid things we say
I know you beat up on yourself
I know it's in your blood
You say what no one understands
The seeds are in your hands
The branches break your bones
I can't just leave you alone
And watch you squirm
And I can't bring myself to look
I rip the pages from the book
And watch it burn


Blue sky us holding down
There's no why
Only the sound of happy TV land
Cue the canned applause
Sidewalk fall through the cracks to China
Never get back
I'm nothing in these blues and laceless Velcro shoes
There used to be a reason why
We wrote the words across the sky
You and I will never die without a fight
My suburban muse
Green grass towering high
This white house, in it we'll die
A thousand tiny lies take the place of you
I've seen it too
In all the things you do
It lives inside of you
A parasite or two
I'm the king of ordinary things
They're killing me from inside out
I'll give it away
Between the cars on dusty streets
The cul de sac is where we meet
I crunch the leaves beneath my feet and curse this town
My suburban muse


Hiding inside a crowd
My head is inside a cloud
Go where the music's loud
And all these talking heads are
Blurred in violet hues 
Another Sunny Day 
She doesn't know wrong from right
She doesn't know when to fight
She only knows that tonight there's always someone out there
She'll never be alone
Another Sunny Day
C'mon get out
Get off the bathroom floor
Daddy's not here no more
I'm showing you to the door
Enough of always numb and always insecure
Hiding inside a cloud
Go where the music's loud
My head is inside a crowd
And all this talk of rock-stars really makes me sick


Welcome to the world
My little virgin baby doll
Can you save me?
I set you off
With the tip of my tongue
Spinning
Never coming back
I wanna dig for gold
Wear the crown of forever lost souls
I'll be nothing
Forever
Jill went up the hill
And gave herself the will
To kill her fear
Now she's unstoppable
Indestructable
The incorruptible
Forever lost soul 
Just a mercy kiss
Born of emptiness
I'm so sick of this
And your fakin'...


Time to give it up
No one needs this any day
Your life's a half-filled cup
You'd never drink from anyway
Well I say
And if you want me to, I'd love to ruin your life
There's nothing else to do
Start a new
Ruin your life
Time to light the fuse
And watch your whole world come undone
Chaos soon ensues
Blow it all to kingdom come
Nice one
Say goodbye
Day after day you never ever crack a smile
You know it's easier to die
It's up to you


Well we never made it through another day
And it's all because you had to have it your way
So lucky you
I wonderin' when I'll be OK
If it's never than it's never
Well your mind is there but your heart is out to lunch
And it's all because your philosophy's just a hunch
T.V. time's over
Father's order


Hey, you know I really liked your show
And hey, I know a place where we could go
And you don't have to do this if it's all you want is love
But hey, I know you really wanna go
How you wanna do this baby?
How you wanna go?
Fill up my emptiness it's you I wanna know
He's just a boy with a nasty seed to sew
There's no more grace to fall from
There's no where left to go but down


Wipe away the summer air
You don't wanna see
That's you in that Photograph from 1973
And you don't even know me
God only Knows I wanna be
The other side of misery
Gimme a plate of Fluorescein
I'm gonna paint an ugly scene
All of the things I wanna say
Can't get a word out anyway
Falling away after today
Nothing to lose so come what may
Don't wake me
You got away from me somehow
And all we tried to be
Everything is different now
The mind's eye fails to see
And all we know is TV


Is it not enough for you 
to be alive
Did you have to create god 
to survive
This is all we have 
and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state are lethal killers
If this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper 
than before
Does it make you feel much better
To stay unaware
Are you living for a heaven
That might not be there
This is all we have 
and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state are lethal killers
If this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper
And now I'm sure 
that this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper 
than before
This is all we have
and all we have is everywhere
This is all we have (Is it not enough for you) to be alive
And all we have is everywhere (to be alive)
This is all we have
and all we have is everywhere
This is all we have (Did you have to create god)
And all we have is everywhere (to survive)
This is all we have 
and all we have is everywhere
There are so many stars
The church and state of lethal killers
If this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper
And now I'm sure 
that this is all we have
Life seems so much better
Life seems so much deeper 
than before


You're sitting next to me
The leaves are on the ground
My heart is in your hands
The ticking of the clock
The siren on the street
My heart is in your hands
But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me
Miles and miles of smiles
Promising the world
It's getting dark down here
We could use a little help
We could use a little spark
Its getting dark down here
But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me
You're sitting next to me
The leaves are on the ground
My heart is in your hands
But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me
But all I ever wanted
All I ever really needed
Was just for you to hear me
Just for you to really know me
All I wanted was you to hear me
And all I needed was you to know me


I am on your side
You light me up inside
You fill my eyes with stars
It doesn't get me very far
Just look around
You don't need no fairy tale
To get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up
But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in 
to space
I am on your side
You light me up inside
You fill my eyes with stars
It doesn't get us very far
Just look around
You don't need no fairy tale
To get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up
But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in
Spotlights shining in 
to space
Just look around
You don't need no government
To get you by
Just look around
You don't need no Santa Claus
You don't need to make things up
But if there's something more than this
I'll meet you sucked inside a kiss
And if there's something more to this
Then I will be the catalyst
I wish I could say something beautiful to
Make you fall in love again
But love has slowly faded away like
Spotlights shining in
Spotlights shining in 
to space


Up in smoke
This is a joke
Isn't it
All your fault
You went too far
Call it quits
No one knew
The dare to prove
Came and went
Moving on
Chance is gone
Throw a fit
So it's through
Nothing's left to lose
It's lucky too
Who needs a tighter noose
You're so weak
Beat up a geek
Makes you complete
Not so tough
I've had enough
Now I leave
Getting away
One more day
Till then I'll sleep
All I need's
A chance to bleed
On me they feed
So it's through
Nothing's left to lose
It's lucky too
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
I know who you are
I know where you're going
So it's through
Nothing's left to lose
It's lucky too
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
Who needs a tighter noose
a tighter noose


What do I do to get your attention
What do I do to get this through
Not the cool kids clique
Not the cool fake hits
What do I do to break this silence
What do I do to make the noise
You prefer to hear
demand to hear
I'm sitting 
I'm standing
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm walking 
I'm running
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm waiting to panic
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
My head is exploding
Like an atom bomb
Like a mushroom cloud
What do I do to get your attention
What do I do to get this through
Mobs of idiots do what you're told to do
Get away from superstition
Get away from boogiemen
In the dark night sky
In the dark corner
I'm sitting 
I'm standing
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm walking 
I'm running
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm waiting to panic
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
My head is exploding
I'm sitting 
I'm standing
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm walking 
I'm running
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm waiting to panic
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
I'm thinking 
I'm thinking
My head is exploding
Like an atom bomb
Like a mushroom cloud


Ginny I know what love is now
I know what we could be
This time it will be different
This time you'll be happy
Stupid twisted irony
You know what your heart is worth
Cause I'm the one who trampled it
And pushed it in the dirt
In time we'll see what grows
I've been hunting through forests 
through the fields
I've been sailing across the raging seas
I've been scaling the mountains
I have got to find a way to bring you home
Ginny I know what love is now
Give your heart for me to keep
This time I wont ruin your life
Or drink myself to sleep
Maybe we could settle down
And plant a tiny family tree
I'll rid myself of what troubles me
And set my little mind free
In time we'll see what grows
I've been hunting through forests
through the fields
I've been sailing across the raging seas
I've been scaling the mountains
I have got to find a way to bring you home
I've been building the tallest sky-scrapers
I've been spinning the earth the other way
I've been adding the numbers
I have got to find a way to bring you home
Ginny I know what love is now
I know what we could be
For what it's worth I love you
If its just too late for me
I've got only me to blame
I've got only me to blame
I've been hunting through forests 
through the fields
I've been sailing across the raging seas
I've been scaling the mountains
I have got to find a way to bring you home
I've been building the tallest sky-scrapers
I've been spinning the earth the other way
I've been adding the numbers
I have got to find a way to bring you home
In time we'll see what grows
In time we'll see
what grows


I am armed to the teeth
You can't hold me down
I've turned seething 
into a hobby
Why is god out to get us
Can't we just be friends
I feel a twinge of righteousness
Like a corporate hedonist
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
Go out and spend
Your money
The thugs are banging
in S.U.V.'s
My thoughts are changing into theories
The master of our destiny
Out in the graveyard of good ideas
That could have been the downfall of leaders
Yeah
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
Go out and spend
Your money
Giants of industry
Come on come on and try to eat me
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
What century 
are you living in
An ancient puzzle piece 
that won't fit in
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready
Go out and spend
Your money
Giants of industry
Come on come on and try to eat me
Armed to the teeth
I'm ready 
I'm ready
I'm ready


Well sooner 
or later
It's all coming down
I float 
down a river
Above my own town
I will fight fire with fire
I will take an eye for every eye
I've got my finger on the trigger
I've got you in my sight
Well sooner 
or later
It's all coming down
And high 
above the city
I ride the wave down
And you won't be stopped till you crush me
And you won't be stopped till you kill us all
But I've got the ultimate weapon
I'm sick of dangling question marks
Well I've got my ducks in a row
Got my head on straight
Cause I know what's love
When the universe breaks my heart
Sooner or later it all comes out in the end
For now hell is all the people 
cause the devil said so
Well I've got my ducks in a row
Got my head on straight
Cause I know what's love
When the universe breaks my heart
Sooner or later it all comes out in the end
For now hell is all the people 
cause the devil said so
Sooner or later
Sooner or later
Sooner or later
Sooner or later
It's all coming down
I will fight fire with fire
I will take an eye for every eye
I've got my finger on the trigger
I've got you in my sights


Damn this destiny
And damn this twist of fate
And damn its 5 A.M.
and I'm still awake
You're haunting me
I know it's hypocrisy
but this is not easy
And this is not what we were supposed to be
So holly
You should know that I'll be
Sailing seas of regret
I can't listen to that CD anymore
To hell with irony
To hell with subtlety
'Cause I don't have time
To mince words anymore
I was there
I'm crouched down in the hall
My ear up to the wall
I can hear you
forgetting about me
So holly
You should know that I'll be
Sailing seas of regret
I can't listen to that CD anymore
Holly
Wasn't very easy
When he took you from me
And I can't listen to that CD anymore
Since you walked out my door
Was it certain death
When he took off your dress
When he finished your cigarettes
So holly
You should know that I'll be
Sailing seas of regret
I can't listen to that CD anymore
Holly
Wasn't very easy
When he took you from me
I can't listen to that CD anymore


Scattered thoughts and scattering masses
The war has just begun
the bully pulpit never had so much fun
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
who wants to get stomped on
All I see are daisies for miles and miles
Lighting universes
The rappers in their limousines just want to be loved
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get served
Like a wrecking ball on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
who wants to get stomped on
Take me back to days of summer
And give me all the simple things
I bet you got that tattooed on your lonely heart
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a renegade who wants to get stomped
Like a wrecking ball held on a string
I'm a hammerhead who wants to get stopped
who wants to get stomped on


What's this thing that's haunting me
Won't my mind just let me be
With you I have to be so sober
Have our plans washed out to sea
Did we drown too easily
It's not sinking in that its over
Maybe then someday
Maybe then someday
Maybe then someday
Maybe then
Maybe then we'll make it right
If I rip you from my chest
Live my life like a scientist
Only logic will destroy me
I will pull apart my bones
To build a fire to keep you warm
And if that's not enough then its ok
Maybe then someday
After all this time
Maybe then someday
We got a lot to loose
Maybe then someday
Maybe then
Maybe then we'll make it right
Well maybe 
Such a desperate word to say
And maybe 
Gets me through another day
And maybe something's got a hold on you
Just maybe
Is becoming maybe not
Yeah.
Maybe then someday
After all this time
Maybe then someday
We got a lot to lose
Maybe then someday
After all this time
Maybe then someday
Maybe then 
Maybe then we'll make it right
After all this time.


Come on 
I'm not washed up
And you're not back luck
For anyone
Come on 
Things got dark
But now our story's just begun
If I was all that I could be
Would you then love me
Despite the history
Stupid things, I know the shame
If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
Come on 
What will it take till you see these are better days
Come on
What will it take for you to find out the hard way
If I was all that I could be
Would you then love me
Despite the history
Stupid things, I know the shame
If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
You might as well come on home
Come home.
Come home.
Come home.
If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
If this is the end of us
I'll sing you this goodbye song
But if you're a lonely girl
You might as well come on home
Come home.
Yeah. 
I'm busting at the seams
To tell you everything
And it's scaring me 
Cause nothing's sure
And nothing makes sense anymore
I'm busting at the seams
To tell you everything
And it's scaring me
Cause nothing's sure
and nothing makes sense anymore


It's not me
Find someone who loves you
And if not me
Find someone who knows who you are
They're just memories
They can get so mean
Little sacred things
Floating out to sea
I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
My life was free
I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be
An empty house
A sacrificial mouse
A head full of lead
Weighing all the things that she said
But I digress
My tunnel vision
Make me pay
I know what i'm missing
I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
My life was free
I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be
So won't you please
Find your way back to me
My one and only
Find your way back to me
I once knew a girl
She once knew me
We had our own world
I like what's free
I loved someone
I set them free
They haven't yet come back to me
But if they do
I'll surely be
More lucky than anyone could be
And if not me
Find someone who loves you


I can push the buttons
I can wrestle with the phantoms
Till I see that all the best things happen naturally
There's nothing I can say to you
The facts and figures make it true
There's nothing else to figure out
The universe will fold in half for us
C'mon
Sublime currency's enough for us
C'mon
It's bigger than the sum of us
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
Don't get excited
But I can't help myself
I can learn the lessons
I can formulate the questions
I can dig and bring to light the heart of everything
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
There's nothing else to figure out
The universe will fold in half for us
C'mon
Sublime currency's enough for us
C'mon
It's bigger than the sum of us
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
Don't get excited
But I can't help myself
Why do you torture yourself for no one?
Why do you keep on the fight?
It's already won
C'mon
Sublime currency's enough for us
C'mon
It's bigger than the sum of us
There's nothing I can say to you
This sublime currency is true
Don't get excited
But I can't help myself


There's no use in crying over
All that should have, would have, could have been
Find I'm better off now anyway
With you here in the end
There's one thing I can say for sure
So great, so ordinary
Hype is the enemy of everything that's beautiful
A trap for fools of miracles
Illuminate the broken hearted
Take over
A little bit bolder
My shouted words don't make a sound
A day older
A little bit bolder
In shadows living underground
Take over
A little bit bolder
Move forward see what life will bring
A day older
A little bit bolder
In silence love is raining down
When I twist and turn the puzzle
Flip it up and over on it's end
When I turn it inside out
I always find you at the end
But I could be over-thinking this
Am I still just trying too hard?
Hype is the enemy of everything that's beautiful
A trap for fools of miracles
Illuminate the broken hearted
Take over
A little bit bolder
My shouted words don't make a sound
A day older
A little bit bolder
In shadows living underground
Take over
A little bit bolder
Move forward see what life will bring
A day older
A little bit bolder
In silence love is raining down


Face your fears
Bottled up somewhere
The thick skin of years
You can erase yourself if you dare
You've been running like a waterfall
Can we stop talking for a little while and maybe
Shed the weight of our former skins maybe
It's right there, somewhere
High, so high
I'm not wasted
I'm just unrehearsed
So come, baby come
I'm not asking
Now it's pouring out your mouth
It's not just luck
Not a trick of the trade
You feel like you're stuck
Getting over the choices we made
You've been running like a waterfall
Can we stop talking for a little while and maybe
Shed the weight of our former skins maybe
It's right there, somewhere
High, so high
I'm not wasted
I'm just unrehearsed
So come, baby come
I'm not asking
Now it's pouring out your mouth


Strong arm man
You do what you want to
You poke my eye
You do what you want to
You behemoth
You go where you want to
You've been stalking me around
You go where you want to
Till you come undone
So tragically
Killing your time
So tragically
Tonight a cold wind blows
Inside my conscience
You are my guiding light
You are my sunshine
When you dream
You are none the wiser
When you shut your eyes
You are none the wiser
Till you come undone
So carelessly
Killing your time
So carelessly
Tonight a cold wind blows
Inside my conscience
You are my guiding light
You are my sunshine
Don't look down
Where you go I go
Slow it down
Where you go I go too
Tonight a cold wind blows
Inside my conscience
You are my guiding light
You are my sunshine


Don't mean to freak you out
But I'm painting pictures
Memories we'll have someday
Don't mean to put you out
But I'm changing channels
So we can stay in bed all day
But all I want is strictly earthly
Sweat and toil and debauchery
Full of love and urgency
I am just a raging sea
Life
Slowly bring me back to
Life
Slowly bring me back to life
Don't mean to freak you out
But the doubt is over
And everything is changing ways
Compared to what you do to me
I am just a ranging sea
Life
Slowly bring me back to
Life
Slowly bring me back to life
In this room I forget about me
Sedate myself with bland TV
Life
Slowly bring me back to
Life
Slowly bring me back to life


Where did you go?
Were you killed in the war?
A casualty of a different sort
Some kind of hurt
You dove head first down through trap doors
You pulled the cord to break your fall
You made escape without a scratch
Or so it seemed
The wounds went deeper
Pull yourself together
It's your son here
Pull yourself together for me
Where did you go?
When we needed you
More than a ghost in the shell of a home
It's not your fault
You don't deserve a tragic end
A solitary homeless king
Surrounded by your piles of junk
It's all you have in a fortress sunken
Pull yourself together
It's your son here
Pull yourself together for me
Where did you go?


Build for me and I'll burn it down
Under siege in a fallen town
Honey believe in me for all time
Honey believe in me for all time
In silence we arrive
Our new halo turns you into gold
In the sadness in your eyes
Our new halo turns you into gold
We can be quiet now
Pull the plug it all ends now
The endless din of a fallen town
Honey believe in me for all time
Honey believe in me for all time
In silence we arrive
Our new halo turns you into gold
In the sadness in your eyes
Our new halo turns you into gold
We can be quiet now
We can be quiet now
For all time
Sort it out
We can be quiet now
In silence we arrive
Our new halo turns you into gold
In the sadness in your eyes
Our new halo turns you into gold
We can be quiet now
We can be quiet now
For all time


Calling this a win
Still here and floating in the wind
We seem to ebb and flow
Always coming close
But then no go
We ebb and flow
A life in slow reverse
Bringing out the guns
Blow this house of cards to kingdom come
We seem to ebb and flow
Always coming close
But then no go
This house of cards
A life in slow reverse
I overflow
And say hello
To a world of marigolds
Heaven knows
Heaven knows
When it’s time to get your
Sea legs back again
Dive into the depths of the ocean
Heaven knows
Heaven knows
Just like something I used to know


Honey I know we've seen bad weather
But what've we lost that's not already gone?
I'm a legionnaire of forces
Climb the walls and burn it down
Fall like dominos
I'm a legionnaire of forces now
(Keep it down now)
So meet me in the wilderness
I'm always on your side
To be with you
Honey I know we've seen bad weather
But what do you know?
It's already gone
We'll watch that empire fall to pieces
A paper tiger ringleader
Fall like dominos
I'm a legionnaire of forces now
(Keep it down now)
So meet me in the wilderness
You and I were made for something more
(Keep it down now)
So cast a light and clear me out
I'm always on your side
To be with you


[Tommy Walter:]
On a distant shore
In the morning undertow
All the ships around awakening
I have not forgotten
Even more determined now
I will wake you up from long sleep
When I am king
I will send out my whole fleet
No island unturned
They will bring you home to me[Paris Carney:]
In the fabric of a very long enchantment
Will you wake me up from long sleep
You were my reflection
In a world abandoned
I will stitch back up our memories
When I am queen
I will weave your tapestry
On my distant shore
Till you find your way to me


So here we are
Follow the rabbit hole down
We will find out
How far down it goes
So do you want to know?
Where we are living in?
In shadows
Are we just animals?
Or something disguised as?
The innocent are fast asleep
A phantom juggernaut in dreams
Have we just lost it?
Have we just lost it?
The idiots are fast asleep
An empire falls beneath our feet
Are we just lost?
So here we are
I'm seeing you out of focus
We will swan dive
Into the abyss


It ain't the clothes that you wear 
It ain't the things that you buy 
It ain't your house on the hill 
It ain't the plane that you fly 
It ain't your black limousine 
It ain't your ninety-foot yacht 
It ain't the things that you'll get 
It ain't the things that you got 
It ain't the money or the diamond rings 
Honey I ain't impressed with your material things [Chorus:] 
It's the way that you love me 
It's just the way that you love me 
It's the way that you love me 
It's just the way that you love me 
It ain't your friends at the top 
It ain't their fortune and fame 
It ain't your heavy connections 
It ain't the Hollywood game 
Ain't famous people or the parties they throw 
Honey I ain't impressed with all the people you know 
It's just the way that you love me 
(In the heat of the night) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(Baby) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(When you're lovin' me right)
It's just the way that you love me 
(Baby) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(And the things that you do) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(Baby) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(Make me crazy for you) 
It's just the way that you love me 
It ain't the money or the diamond rings 
Honey I ain't impressed with those material things
It ain't the trips to Brazil 
It ain't the weekends in Rome 
It ain't the French Riviera 
You know I'd rather stay home 
Ain't the Bahamas
It ain't Monaco 
Honey I ain't impressed 
With all the places we go 
It's just the way that you love me 
The way that you love me 
The way that you love me 
It's just the way that you love me 
The way that you love me 
(It ain't the money) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(Or the diamond rings) 
The way that you love me 
(Ain't what you buy my baby) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(Ain't material things) 
The way that you love me 
(Ain't your Maserati) 
It's just the way that you love me 
(Your house on the hill) 
The way that you love me 
(It ain't the parties) 
It's just the way that you love me


I was in love the moment that I saw you 
I followed you thru the crowd and I almost lost you 
I was dying to tell you but scared of your reaction 
But I can't hold back because I'm rushed with thing called passion [Chorus:] 
You've got me knocked out turn me inside out 
It's you that makes my heart beat 
You've got me knocked out 
Baby there's no doubt 
You swept me off of my feet
I walked your way hoping that 
Maybe you noticed 
I don't want to move so fast 
I don't want to blow it 
Never did I think love could be so amazing 
But the things that you're making me do 
It's driving me crazy 
I want us to be closer, boy I wanna be 
Startin' somethin with you baby 
My heart is steady knockin boy you've got my body rockin', caught 
blow-by-blow, love T.K.O.


I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it 
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it 
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool 
With my homegirl, Paula Abdul 
Baby seems we never ever agree 
You like the movies 
And I like T.V. 
I take things serious 
And you take 'em light 
I go to bed early 
And I party all night 
Our friends are sayin' 
We ain't gonna last 
Cuz I move slowly 
And baby I'm fast 
I like it quiet 
And I love to shout 
But when we get together 
It just all works out [Chorus:] 
I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
Who'd a thought we could be lovers 
She makes the bed 
And he steals the covers 
She likes it neat 
And he makes a mess 
I take it easy 
Baby I get obsessed 
She's got the money 
And he's always broke 
I don't like cigarettes 
And I like to smoke 
Things in common 
Just ain't a one 
But when we get together 
We have nothin' but fun 
I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract [Repeat Chorus]
Baby ain't it somethin' 
How we lasted this long 
You and me 
Provin' everyone wrong 
Don't think we'll ever 
Get our differences patched 
Don't really matter 
Cuz we're perfectly matched [Repeat Chorus Twice][Sung in the "ShutUp & Dance" version and in the "Opposites Attract" Music Video]
Nothing in common but this trust 
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus 
One going up, one coming down 
But we seem to land on common ground 
When things go wrong we make corrections 
To keep things moving in the right direction 
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack 
Its true- this- Opposites Attract


Such a mess, such a funny feeling 
I must confess, I never felt like this before 
Runnin' hot, runnin' my emotions 
Your lovin' shock, goes through me like an open door 
Ooh my heart's in animation 
You got me beating in double time
State of attraction 
Somehow you make my body come alive 
My arms wanna hold ya 
My lips wanna kiss 
Ya make me want to want you 
This is strange, this is all a new thing 
What a change, I know that real life ain't like this 
Goin' mad, goin' past the love zone 
Got it bad, got it so I can't resist 
I'm in a deep suspension 
A limbo void of time...I'm in a 
State of attraction 
You're just a magnet to this heart of mine 
These eyes wanna know ya 
These hands wanna touch 
Cause I'm affected by you 
State of attraction 
Somehow you make my body come alive 
My arms wanna hold ya 
My lips wanna kiss 
Ya make me want to want you 
Pick and roll me off the wall
This is love science, a chemical reaction 
Ooh baby, to resist ain't worth tryin' 
Cause once ya start the action...you're in a [Chorus]


All alone, it's you and me 
Time to tell you now just how I feel 
Babe to you I bare my heart 
A light of love, here in the dark 
(Don'cha know) I might be strong 
But deep down there's a sweetness 
Only you can touch and make me feel 
(Oh h h) what a joy
You're such a perfect lover yes 
You always know just what to do 
I--I I need you... 
At the start, I couldn't say 
All my feelings I could not portray 
But I gotta tell ya now, 
That I really need your love, babe 
Oh, it's comin' on strong 
(I feel) so secure 
When you are here beside me 
There is nothin' that can bring me down 
(Oh and) more and more 
You take me way up high, babe 
And you teach me what love is all about 
I--I I need you.


Hey baby 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 
Baby forever...and ever and ever 
(You know I am) 
Baby pick your head up 
Come on and look me in the face 
Cuz I can tell that somethin' 
Is bringin' you down 
(Why are you down?) 
Is it the rumor 
That another boy 
Wants to take your place 
(I hear he's after your heart) 
Have you been hearin' the stories 
They're goin' around 
(All of my friends are talkin') 
Baby just remember I gave you my heart 
Ain't no one gonna tear us apart 
He could promise the moon 
And the stars above 
Even if he promised me the world 
Just remember I'm forever your girl 
He could promise the world 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 
Honey listen to me 
Your love is all I need 
You should know that I don't need nothin' 
That money can buy 
(It's no lie) 
So if a boy were to come along 
And try to make me leave you 
(Girl I'd go out of my mind) 
There'd be no need to worry 
I'm tellin' you why 
(I need to hear that you really love me) 
Baby don't you know that I love you 
And I'd never put nobody above you 
He could promise the moon and the stars above 
Even if he promised me the world 
Just remember I'm forever your girl 
He could promise the world 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 
I'm forever your baby 
Just remember I'm forever your girl 
He could promise the world 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl 
When the mountains crumble into the sea 
That's the day someone'll come 
Between you and me 
Baby just remember I gave you my heart 
(Tell me) ain't no one gonna tear us apart 
Baby he could promise me diamonds 
Even if he promised me pearls 
Honey you know I ain't lyin' 
Listen as I tell it to the world 
You gotta remember baby remember 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever your girl
Baby forever and ever and ever 
We'll be together 
I'm forever your girl 
Baby forever and ever and ever 
You gotta remember 
I'm forever... 
Hey baby he could promise the world 
Girl you know I love you 
And I always will 
If we live 'til forever 
I'll be lovin' you 
I'll be lovin' you still 
I'm forever your girl


Lost in a dream 
Don't know which way to go 
If you are all that you seem 
Then baby I'm movin' way too slow 
I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
How about some information--please [Chorus:]
Straight up now tell me 
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh 
Or am I caught in a hit and run 
Straight up now tell me 
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh 
Are you just having fun 
Time's standing still 
Waiting for some small clue 
I keep getting chills 
When I think your love is true 
I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
How about some information--please [Chorus:] 
Straight up now tell me 
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh 
Or am I caught in a hit and run 
Straight up now tell me 
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh 
Are you just having fun 
You are so hard to read 
You play hide and seek 
With your true intentions 
If you're only playing games 
I'll just have to say--bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye 
Do do you love me 
Do do you love me 
Do do you love me 
Do do you love me ?
I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
Are you more than hot for me 
Or am I a page in your history-book 
I don't mean to make demands 
But the word and the deed go hand in hand 
How about some information--please [Chorus cont.]
I've been a fool before 
Wouldn't like to get my love caught 
In the slammin' door 
Are you more than hot for me 
Or am I a page in your history-book 
I don't mean to make demands 
But the word and the deed go hand in hand 
How about some information--please [Chorus out]


When we met 
The sparkle in your eyes 
Showed me that 
We were meant to be 
In love 
Sharing our fantasies 
You touched me 
Then we kissed 
I could not believe 
That love was so strong 
It didn't take too long 
To learn 
Love will go on and on 
Love's an everlasting bond 
When I'm next to you 
Our love flows through 
I can't explain 
What you do 
When I'm next to you 
I feel brand new 
I love you for 
All the things you do 
Can't deny 
The feelings deep inside 
Our hearts and minds 
Love is alive 
It's true 
I'm so into you 
I love you [Solo][Chorus:] 
When I'm next to you 
Our love flows through 
I can't explain 
What you do 
When I'm next to you 
I feel brand new 
I love you for 
All the things you do 
You know when I'm all alone 
And you're so far away 
I wish that you were here 
Holding me 
And I find myself thinking 
Of how it would be 
Knowing you're with me 
I love the way I feel 
When I look into your eyes 
--I love you baby-- 
I love the way I feel 
When I'm standing by your side 
--And I want you baby; I need you 
When I'm next to you 
Our love flows through 
I can't explain 
What you do 
When I'm next to you 
I feel brand new 
I love you for 
All the things you do


How come how come he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a 
Always always number number one without a doubt 
(He's one cold snake) 
When-a when-a he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin' 
Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock 
(No give, all take) 
You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love 
And he's been only only playing undercover all the while 
(One smooth sharp tongue) 
Take a take another 'nother look into his eyes 
(He just talks) 
And you will on-ly see a rep-tile 
He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh oh oh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by the rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 
You're the one givin' up the love 
Anytime he needs it 
But you turn your back and then he's off and runnin' with the crowd 
You're the one to sacrifice 
Anything to please him 
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out 
He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh oh oh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 
It was only late last night 
He was out there sneakin' 
Then he called you up to check that you were waiting by the phone 
All the world's a candy store 
He's been trick or treatin' 
When it comes to true love girl with him there's no one home 
He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh oh oh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--no 
You could find somebody better girl 
He could only make you cry 
You deserve somebody better girl 
He's c-cold as ice 
He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh oh oh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh --Girl don't play the fool--no 
He's a cold-hearted snake 
Look into his eyes 
Oh oh oh 
He's been tellin' lies 
He's a lover boy at play 
He don't play by rules 
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool--[Repeat To Fade]


If you think you're gonna have the time 
To make up your mind 
You shouldn't even try 
I'm tired of hearing all of your lines 
Just tell me that you're mine 
You know I'm better than she'll ever be 
It's very clear to me 
No more 
I'll let you mess with me 
But baby can't you see [Chorus:] 
You can only have (one or the other) 
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me ?
You can only have (one or the other) 
If it's gonna be her 
You gotta set me free 
Let me tell you that it hurts so bad 
When you're the last to know 
My friends told me so 
My heart was always just for you 
But now you want her too 
You see her you try her 
You're always on fire 
But boy I've got news for you 
You've taken advantage 
But baby you can't have 
Your cake and eat it too 
One or the other 
You can't get it right 
You say I'm your lover 
But someone else is waiting 
One or the other 
I'm not gonna fight 
This won't last forever 
So stop your hesitating 
One or the other 
You can't get it right 
You're so undercover you always think I'm playing 
One or the other 
You want me tonight 
I'm not gonna play 
It boy 
I'm not with it 
One or the other
You got to get it right 
Said ya can't have 
Your cake and eat it too

WAIT TO BEGIN AGAIN 
LIFTED ABOVE BY A LOVE 
THAT DOES NOT END [Chorus:]  
I'M ALRIGHT TONIGHT 
I'M ALRIGHT 
YOU'RE ALRIGHT TONIGHT 
YOU'RE ALRIGHT  
WE'RE ALRIGHT TONIGHT 
IT'S ALRIGHT TONIGHT 
YOU PICKED UP SOME PIECES OF LIGHT 
AS YOU BROKE THROUGH THE SPEED OF SOUND 
I WAS ROCKIN' AROUND IN MY OWN TWO-DIMENSIONAL WAY 
NOW WHEN I HEAR THAT JET ENGINE BLOW 
THEN I KNOW YOU ARE LEAVING TOWN 
BABY, I'D FOLLOW YOU TO THE EDGE OF IT ALL, ANYWAY 
UP WHERE THE KINGDOM COMES 
DOWN WHERE THE STREETS TAKE THE BREATH OF ANOTHER YOUNG GUN 
LOVE IS A WHISPERED PRAYER 
SHOT LIKE A SPARK THROUGH THE HEART 
OF DARK DESPAIR [Chorus]
I DON'T REGRET ANY NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD INDISCRETIONS 
I CAN STILL FIT BOTH MY FEET IN MY MOUTH, ANYWAY 
BUT THESE DAYS I'M JUST NOT AS WILLING TO NURSE THE OBSESSION 
(NO NO NO)
IF THE DOC SAYS IT'S GOT TO COME OUT 
THEN I'M HAPPY TO PAY [Chorus x2]


JUST GIRL TO BOY 
I'D LIKE TO SHARE THIS THOUGHT WITH YOU 
OUR LOVE'S A JOY 
TWO ONE'S HAVE MADE INSEPARABLE TWO 
LAST NIGHT MY HEART SPOKE TO ME AND 
IT SAID YOU'VE FOUND THAT LOVER FRIEND 
SO NOW I'VE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE JUST TO ASK YOU BABY OOH [Chorus:] 
WILL YOU, WILL YOU 
WILL YOU MARRY ME BOY 
WILL YOU, WILL YOU 
WILL YOU MARRY ME 
WILL YOU, WILL YOU 
WILL YOU MARRY ME BOY 
WILL YOU, WILL 
WILL YOU, WILL YOU, WILL YOU 
COME ON BABY NOW 
I LAY AWAKE 
SO FULL WITH HOPE OF THINGS TO COME 
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE 
I PRAY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE 
I NEVER DREAMED I'D BE SO BOLD 
I'M STANDING HERE, MY HEART'S BEEN SOLD 
SO NOW I'VE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE  JUST TO ASK YOU BABY OOH [Chorus][Spoken:] 
THINK OF LOVE AS WINGS 
NOT A BALL AND CHAIN 
AND YOUR FEAR OF THINGS 
UNNECESSARY 
I ONLY WANT TO SHARE YOUR NAME 
SHARE YOUR NAME 
LAST NIGHT MY HEART SPOKE TO ME AND 
IT SAID YOU'VE FOUND THAT LOVER FRIEND 
SO NOW I'VE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE JUST TO ASK YOU BABY OOH [Chorus]
MAYBE SUNDAY 
COME ON MONDAY 
BABY ANY TIME THIS WEEK 
GET AN OLD HOUSE 
FIND A BACK YARD 
BUY SOME FLOWERS DOWN THE STREET 
TELL YOUR MOTHER 
TELL YOUR FATHER 
DON'T TELL ANYONE AT ALL 
ALL WE NEED IS 
JUST THE TWO OF US 
AND OOH...


Sitting, chilling, thinking about you babe
You're like a long, cool glass of lemonade - mmmm
Bitter, sweet and I want you so bad it hurts
You complete my life and you quench my thirst--sexy
Sexy feelings just come over me
Playing with my dress like a summer breeze
Gentle as the touch of a falling leaf 
You open me up to love 
Now I gotta believe, gotta believe[Bridge:] 
Nothing's too good for my baby 
Anything you want be free 
It's the least that I can do 
What you've given me, given me[Chorus:]  
Cause I'm cool, Crazy Cool,  Crazy cool with you
In this -uh-groove, Crazy groove 
Baby act a fool
Hey I'm cool,  Crazy Cool, You're crazy cool with me
In this groove, Crazy Cool, Everything you need, SEXY 
Laying in the grass, writing poetry
Looking up at the midnight sun 
While you're making love to me
You showed me just how cool Crazy Cool can be
Now I know meaning of ecstasy, ecstasy  [Bridge][Chorus (out)][Single Version:]   
Nothing's too good for my baby 
Anything you want be free 
You open me up to love 
ooh I Gotta Believe


I made mistakes when I played with your mind
Gave you excuses with each story line
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real
Watching you wondering what I feel inside 
Deep in my soul I've got nothing to hide
If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real 
So baby please don't worry 
I wanna make it better 
I wanna be your only love
This time I'll understand you
I'll never leave your side
This time it's got to be for you
Let's put an end to these long lonely nights
Things that were once wrong now turned out all right
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real 
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real 
You told me, you loved me 
You said that 
I need you, you want me
I told you
So baby I won't tease you
I'm gonna make it better
I wanna be your only love
This time I'll understand you 
I'll never leave your side 
This time it's got to be for you 
If you ask me how I feel 
My love is for real


Well there's not a bit of truth in what you hear 
Just a whole lot of jealousy out there smearin' 
My good name all over the place 
Just to get you thinkin' that I'm -- two faced 
But I would never go south
I was never dreamin' of anybody else
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but babe the truth is
Ain't never gonna give you up
Ain't never gonna let you down babe
Ain't never gonna give you up
Hey hey hey hey
Yea yea yea 
Ain't never gonna give you up
Yea yea yea
Ain't never gonna let you down 
I wanna be right there for you so don't
Believe another word cause all of these low -- girls
Only wanna put the split between us
They keep getting off on all -- the fuss
But I will always treat you
Just the way I always promised I'd do
You're the only one I'd ever be with
I got a whole lot to say but babe the truth is[Chorus]
Baby don't you know that I want to be with you[Chorus]


It all went down at the cantina that she liked
Everyone would watch her as she danced all through the lights
She was the center of attraction in his mind
Maria thought she'd never find a man worth her time
Oooo he came into the room
Oooo she really liked the way that he began to move
They were in the mood for romancin'
There's a fire in little Havana
Flame so hot you can't stand it
Things are getting a little crazy
Someone better tell them that
Love don't come that easy
(I know you're ready boy)
We've got to control all emotions that we're feeling
Love don't come that easy
We've gotta be strong -- swing
We've gotta stay strong -- straight
As he took her in his arms
She got an instant chill 
A sense of passion
She thought no one could make her feel
Their bodies moved with such intensity
The lights went down 
Made sighs of pleasure
Like there was no one else around
Ooh now she's in the mood
Ooh to show him what she wants to do
She's got him crazy
There's a fire in little Havana
Flame so hot ya can't stand it
Thing's are gettin' a little crazy
Can you feel it -- ooh
Are you ready -- ooh [Chorus]


Brokenhearted 
Unsatisfied
I can't help it I can't get you off my mind
She was so wrong 
To treat you bad
She didn't know you were the best she'd ever had
If I were yours
And you were mine
I'd make sure that I could please you all the time
I'd be here waiting 
I'd treat you right
If I were your girl
I'd keep up all night
Appreciate you 
There's so much more
I would give you
If I were your girl 
So frustrated 
What do I do
I get excited when I'm standing next to you
Does she love you
Is she unkind
I don't know why you're there cause something isn't right 
All the wonders of the world 
Are the things that I would give if I were her [Chorus]
I never felt this way inside
It's so hard, so very hard to hide
Cause I can see
That you don't receive
The things you deserve
I'd give you so much more
If I were your girl


Day or night it's the way of life 
Whatever keeps me pumpin' 
Whatever makes me feel alright 
Well I've been tryin' to find myself 
I was in a trance but now I feel like dancin' 
Put on your platforms, get your move on 
Won't flow to nothin' I don't like 
My vibe is mental, it's never gentle 
You gotta do your own thing move it side to side 
Now if you love yourself, throw your hands in the air 
And if you think you're sexy 
Clap your hands like you just don't care 
All you gotta do 
Sexy things 
Is be a little sexy 
Bring sexy thoughts 
All you gotta do 
Sexy thoughts, SEX 
Is be a little sexy 
I got an attitude 
I got a complex 
I'm feeling funky, I bet'cha knew that 
When you saw me 
You thought you could take me to another place 
But I ain't hip to that 
I ain't with that 
Here come the spotlights 
I gotta get mine, so move that body 
If you ain't got it 
It's all about strength, poise, so make some noise 
You don't have to let nobody know 
How you're gonna steal the show 
Now if you love yourself, throw your hands in the air 
And if you think you're sexy 
Clap your hands like you just don't care [Chorus]


Lately I've had my doubts 
About the way you feel 
Tell me there is no other love 
You see but me, ooooh 
I've been a good woman to you 
Give you sweet love every night 
Break up, make up 
That's all that we do 
So if you better want my love 
You've got to go down 
The choice is yours 
The choice is yours 
The choice is yours if you can find something better 
The choice is yours 
The choice is yours 
Just like it seems you know it really don't matter 
Don't be a fool and take too long 
To make your move 
A woman like me deserves a knight 
In armor too 
I've been a good woman to you 
Give you sweet love every night 
Break up, make up 
That's all that we do 
So if you better want my love 
You've got to go down [Chorus]
I never give in to friends 
That don't give in to me 
Treat me with love 
Desire to be with only me [Chorus]


That's what I want 
That's what I need 
That's what I want 
Ho down 
She sprays her lies around her like the clouds release the rain 
An endless stream of promises that vaporize again 
Remember last Tuesday when you said it was the end 
You caught her in your Nissan getting funky with your best friend 
She will never change till her flesh is under dirt 
But then at least she's hangin' with neighbors she deserves 
Forgive me if I seem to sound a little on the loose 
But I cannot pour sugar just to sweeten up the truth 
I would like to wish for her a long forgotten dream 
Happened early morning when I was two or three 
Everyone around who didn't quite fit in the mix 
Turned and waved goodbye and disappeared without a hitch 
Except my friend Billy who lived just across the way 
The world belonged to us forever on from that day 
Until we ran into that sneaky girl from down the street 
Who tried to smile so pretty stealing Billy right from me [Chorus]
The world spun around her everywhere that she would go 
But even my friend Billy knew that she was just a -- oh no 
She had such a way to twist and turn a simple truth 
Told my friend Billy I had been a little loose 
Then Billy took her arm and left me standing all alone 
I just had to wait there watching them do-se-do 
Till Billy pushed her in the deepest darkest hole around 
It was goodbye sneaky girl -- ho down 
I would like to wish for her a place to somewhere far 
A place in outer space to some exotic little star 
A million miles away would probably suit the planet fine 
Someplace where it's clear she is gone and you are mine 
Or maybe some romantic little island in the sea 
As far away as it is possible to be 
She can have the flowers and the wind 
And I can have my baby back with me once again [Chorus]
I would like to wish for her another little story 
My daddy said to me when I was just a little girly 
He told me 'bout a pretty graceful lovely lady bird 
Who never could find a nest good enough for her 
From every tree she landed in she saw one that was better 
So off she went before she ever could regain her breath 
Wasn't it a pity when she finally hit the ground 
It was goodbye lovely birdy -- ho down 
Goodbye lovely birdy ho down --


I fell in love 
When I first spotted you among the crowd 
Your eyes met mine 
And that's when the room started spinning around 
Suddenly 
I couldn't breathe 
I felt my knees 
Getting weak 
And baby I could not think straight 
I had to move 
Closer to you 
Talk to you 
But you had left me in an altered state 
And it was driving me insane 
Under the influence 
Baby you got me 
Under...fascinated, intoxicated (cuz I'm) 
Under the influence 
Oh baby you got me 
Under the influence of you 
I moved your way 
It's more like gravity was steerin' my heart 
What can I say 
(I want to be your lover baby) 
Be your lover right from the start 
I had to go 
Very slow 
Vertigo 
Was rushin' through my body 
And my brain 
I was mesmerized 
Hypnotized 
To my surprise 
You told me that you felt the same way 
And it was driving you insane [Chorus]
I had to go 
Very slow 
Vertigo 
Was rushin' through my body 
And my brain 
Mesmerized 
Hypnotized 
To my surprise 
You told me that you felt the same way 
And it was driving you insane [Chorus]


Now you tell me since you've been away 
There was something you've been dying to say 
Yes, I thought you had eyes for me 
But I never was quite sure 
Mighty funny that you never called 
Ain't it funny now that you're gone 
That you say you're in love with me 
Now that's hard for me to believe 
Cause I never knew it baby, never knew it baby 
I never knew it baby, never knew it baby 
That you loved me so 
Now I think about you every night 
Said you wanted for us to have fun 
What's the matter, cat got your tongue 
It's not easy to read your mind 
So you bet not take too long 
Kind of silly just holding the phone 
Ain't it silly that I'm all alone 
When you should be here holding me 
Or making good love baby, oh so sweet [Chorus]
I knew somebody would love me 
And satisfy this heart of mine 
You never should keep it from me 
You gotta realize a girl would cry and loose her mind... [Chorus]


I can feel this energy building up inside of me 
It wants to get out 
It wants to let go 
Do you feel the way I feel with your little sex appeal baby, baby 
Now we move left to right side to side and grind 
We can do it all night 
There really ain't nothing to it but to do it boy 
So let me show you how to move your body baby 
I know we can work it out feel the sense of chemistry 
We can do it anyway, anyway you like 
Can you feel it, 'cause it's so strong 
So you better get, get your groove on 
'Cause it's funky, don't wait too long 
Or you won't get, get that groove on 
Just feel the rhythm flow 
Feel it run through your veins 
It's a rush baby (and no one can take it away) 
I'm so attracted to you (so come here close to me) 
Boy you know how I like it 
I like it physical 
I like it sexual baby, baby 
There ain't no holding back now 
So let me show you how I'm gonna give it to you 
Baby we can dance all night 
Boy there really ain't nothing to it [Chorus]
Well I'm steppin' so you better catch on 'cause there ain't nothing to it 
Baby move here close if you want to keep your groove on with me [Chorus]


Everybody's got to cry sometimes 
I never understood the reason why 
Suddenly the answer is so clear I'm... 
Missing you 
Never thought that we would end this way 
And if I only had three words to say 
They would simply flow so easy, I'm... 
Missing you 
Casa blanca and white orchids I sent to you 
Just a symbol of hope that you still love me to 
I'm missing you baby 
I'm missing you honey 
(I'm missing you) 
We can't be through 
I'm missing you darlin' 
(I'm missing you) 
Everybody's got to hurt sometimes 
I always ask myself the question why 
Now my pain easily explains, I... 
I long for you 
If I had a chance once again 
I'd approach us like a love song 
So tenderly I'd orchestrate us to be 
(A sweet melody) 
Sending you romantic cards 
to remind you of us 
Just a token to entice you to 
Come back to love 
I'm missing you baby 
I'm missing you honey 
(I'm missing you) 
A love so true 
I'm missing you darlin' 
(I'm missing you) 
Baby I will take the blame 
So let's stop playing silly games 
If it will bring you back to me 
Baby I'll say that I'm sorry 
I will gladly sacrifice 
To have you back in my life 
I'm beggin you honey please 
Come back to me darlin' 
Everybody's got to cry sometimes 
I never understood the reason why 
The answer is so clear to me now [Chorus]


Baby I'm down to what you want 
But there's some conditions you'll have to follow 
You know that I'm not afraid to party 
So do you wanna have some fun 
You're gonna have to get to know me better 
let's 
go where the music's pumpin' 
That's where I want to be 
Don't think about anything else boy 
I'm feelin' right so just vibe with me tonight 
Cuz it's all about feeling good 
You've got to free your mind 
It feels so good when the music hits ya 
It's all about feeling good 
You've got to ease your mind 
Baby get into it, cuz it feels so right 
I'm hip to the way, the way we get along 
I never thought you had it in ya, you're trying to turn me out 
Now you think you're all that baby, let me show you how 
How you do it, I know I can hold my own 
Baby how you feeling now 
Don't trip I'm just grooving to the music 
Just let your body flow 
Boy come here move a little closer 
It's all about, it all about a good time tonight [Chorus]


Close my eyes at night 
Who do I see 
Standing right in front of me 
Is it the one I try to forget 
From my heart all my tears they flow 
Never wanting to let you go 
But somehow I did 
You were out to 
Cry for me 
Pray that I can somehow see 
I have nothing left to cry for you 
tears they flow 
Never wanting to let you go 
But somehow I did 
You were out to 
Cry for me 
Pray that I can somehow see 
I have nothing left to cry for you 
You will have to 
Cry my tears 
Pray I let go of my fears 
I have nothing left to cry for you 
I don't know where I got on 
Where I let go 
But somehow I thin[Chorus]
I'd love to forget about way back when 
And forgive you of the hurt again 
But I've tried, oh I've tried 
So you will have to [Chorus]
Cry for me.


I had everything I ever wanted in my life 
Wasn't lookin' for nobody to be satisfied 
Wasn't looking for a honey or a steady girl 
'Til I turned around the corner 
And you rocked my world 
You was walkin' down the street 
Body boomin' to the beat 
You had everything complete 
You was cold- too cold 
And the funky things you said 
Was like music to my head 
And you turnded around and said 
Baby let's go 
You're so sexual...(sexual) 
So intellectual...(so incrediable) so emotional (emotional) 
You have everything I want... 
Everything I need [Chorus:]  
Upside down you're turning me 
Ooh it's an emergency 
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love (Crazy Love) 
I want your body next to me 
Ooh with such an urgency
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love 
I hear everybody talkin' 
That your mind ain't right 
And my friends say I gone crazy girl but that's alright 
Cuz the things we do together 
They mean so much more 
Boy you got me feeling things 
I've never felt before 
You're so sexual...(Sexual) 
So intellectual...(So Incrediable) so incrediable (Emotional) 
You have everything I want... [Chorus x2:] 
Upside down you're turning me 
Ooh it's an emergency 
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love (Crazy Love) 
I want your body next to me 
Ooh with such an urgency
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love 
Do you know what you want baby ? 
Do you like what you see ? 
Mmmm, Do you wanna have some fun with me ? 
I can give you just a little taste 
Just a little bit 
I can give it all to you 
Can you handle it- Huh!
Let me have it all, yes 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
oh 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, 
Let me have it all, Everything need yeah- [Chorus:]  
Upside down you're turning me 
Ooh it's an emergency 
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love (Crazy Love) 
I want your body next to me 
Ooh with such an urgency
Could it be I'm fallin' for your crazy love 
You know you drive me crazy, 
You know you drive me crazy for your crazy love, 
You know you drive me crazy, 
You know you drive me crazy for your crazy love, 
You know you do, 
You know you do, you drive me crazy, come on, you know 
You drive me, you know you do you know you do, drive me crazy, you know 
You drive me- Crazy for your CRAZY LOVE !


Look out my window 
Rain comin' down 
Waitin' at the corner 
Kids all wearin' their frowns 
Just another Monday 
Goin' to school 
Till you come along 
Kickin' your heels 
Lookin' my way- makin' me feel real 
You made me blush... 
You were my high school crush...(ahhhhh) 
Billy got married 
Lizzy left town 
Barrie went to New York City 
She's dancin' around 
You went off to college to conquer the word 
I stayed home 
Thinkin' 'bout you 
Now you're back, what am I gonna do? 
You made me blush... 
You were my high school crush...(ahhhhh) 
Now give me back my dream 
Ooh, how the tables turned 
I see your eyes 
And I feel the burn 
One thing I know for sure 
They'll never find a cure 
For what I got for you 
My love is true 
Now you're back 
Kickin' your heels 
Lookin' my way- makin' me feel real 
You made me blush 
But that was high school (yea) 
I loved you so much 
But time is changing all the rules 
Enough is enough 
This ain't no high school crush 
This time now I'm ready to be with you 
This ain' no high school crush


He led me astray 
When my mind was weak 
That's all I can say 
Ba-baby 
He filled me with words 
And knew I would believe 
He's nothing but dirt 
Sorry 
If you bend time back 'round 
Will you bend it to me? 
If you bend time back 'round 
Will you bend it to me? 
If you bend time back 'round 
Will you bend it to me? 
If you bend time back 'round 
Will you bend it to me? 
He's a pretty face 
Dressed up to the "T" 
Nothing but a space 
Underneath 
I felt like a fool 
I turned from you so fast 
Time takes me from you 
Bend it back [Chorus]
If I could do it once again 
I'd never let the bastard in 
He's puttin' on a show 
The curtain's crashing down and closin' 
I wish to back up my steps 
So you'd have nothing to forget 
A flip to reality 
I wanna pretend you did not see it 
Dika dika dy-i-i, dika dika doo 
Dika dika dy-i-i, dika dika doo 
Dika dika dy-i-i, dika dika doo 
Dika dika dy-i-i, dika dika doo 
Twisted up in knots 
He had me so confused 
He turned my every thought 
Away from you 
I was drifted out 
On a fantasy 
But now I'm comin' 'round 
Back to me [Instrumental]
Du doop du doop doo, hey- du doop du doop doo 
Du doop du doop doo  hey- du doop du doop doo 
Du doop du doop doo, hey -du doop du doop doo 
Du doop du doop doo, hey- du doop du doop doo 
If you bend time back 
Bend it back to me 
(Oh) 
If you bend time back 
Bend it back to me 
(Oh) 
(I said) [Chorus 2x to fade]


[Chorus:]
All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night 'n' dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow
Today just wasn't my day
Everyone's getting me so fed up
I gotta find a way
I know what can make me feel better
Stepping out in my best
Looking hotter than ever
Wherever the party is
That's where I'll be in a second
I'm ready to move my body
Forget about all my problems
When I hear my song
I'm a lose control
(hee hee)
I go[Chorus]
I'm loving the atmosphere
Feels like I'm floating in heaven
The music's all in my ear
Taking over me
My hearts racing
Feeling so Hollywood
How I got everybody staring
There eyes on the cameras
And I'm loving all the attention
Get up to move my body
Forget about all my problems
When I hear my song
I'm a lose control
(hee hee)
I go[Chorus]
Please DJ don't say it's the last call
'Cause I know what it means
And I don't want you to play no slow song
I'm still building it up to talk to that guy
Just give me another song and make it right
I just wanna stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night and dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow[Chorus]


Something sweet fills my soul with wonder 
Tender arms wrap me in my slumber 
Cherished thoughts keep our hearts together 
Safe and warm, nothing could be better 
I will be there whenever you call me 
Didn't I say I love you I will be there to keep your tears from falling 
Didn't I say I do 
Just a breath passing from your two lips 
And I forget everything, I lose it 
Just a look makes me feel the madness 
In my world no one else will have it [Chorus]
Time may change some things 
But you and me will always last forever 
Dreams may come and go but we, we know 
Will always be together 
(Didn't I say I love you, boy) [Chorus]
I will be there no matter what the reason 
Didn't I say I love you 
I will be there and I will never leave you 
Didn't I say I do


Good night, my love 
Good night, my love 
Good night, my love 
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love 
May tomorrow be sunny and bright 
And bring you closer to me 
Before you go 
There's just one thing I want to know 
Is your love still warm for me 
Or has it gone cold? 
If you should awake 
In the still of the night 
Please have no fears 
I'll be there 
You know I care 
Please give your love to me, dear [repeat first verse]
Good night, my love


MC Skat Kat: Well You've never seen a kat with so much charisma 
Got More Moves than a mutant nina- turtle that is 
And I'm doing the Skat Strut 
To hell with John Travolta and the Disco Duck 
They call me Skat Kat, the dance floor maniac 
One more of my hip is like an afro-disiac 
Swinging and wingingI'm just doing my own thing 
Girls don't jump me 
Give me room to be funky 
Step to the dance floor bust a little spin 
(I thought I saw a putty kat, I did) 
SHUT UP KID!! 
This is a new dance so shake your butt 
And get a load of what its like to be doing  Skat Strut 
Now Jack was nimble and Jack was quick 
But it was Skat Kat that made Jack trip 
I burned him on the butt with a flick of my bic 
And then I cold ran away with the candle stick 
I've got all the right moves 
Ladies think I'm Loveable 
Love to wine and dine sippin' on bubble 
But most of all, I like dancing y'all 
And doing my Skat Strut from wall to wall 
It's as simple as it gets, just stick out your neck 
Lift up your leg and step to the left 
Now shake a little as you groove to the beat 
--Bend over, shake your big booty 
And if you get dizzy from shaking your butt 
You must have shook the wrong end cuz you ain't doing 
The Skat Strut (I though I saw a putty kat- I did, I did) 
As we go a little something like this-- Hit it!! 
Without a question, its the strut to fame 
I can see myself now on the aisles of "Soul Train" 
People want to know if its meant to be silly 
I say only when it's done by Milli and Vanilli 
The dance is mine a generation of felines 
Mastered this step back in '69 
Return of the Skat Strut a brand new dance 
(I thought I) could but you can't-- BUST IT 
Homeboy Fatz, Why don't you step up to the microphone 
And give them a little taste of 
Your beat box boy--- 
FATZ: Hey man, I've told you 
I don't like nobody telling me what to do 
Now I'm a beat-box, but I'm a do-it-my-way 
Anybody got something to say? 
MC Skat Kat: For those who don't know me, 
My name is Skat 
I'm the kat who did the rap in "Opposites Attract" 
Me and Paula did a duo and then I went solo 
To grab the microphone and make the ladies go
HO!
And now that I've got you at my command 
Its my sole opportunity to make you dance 
I want all four paws on the dance floor 
Do that strut until your legs get sore 
Come on! Come on! Come on!


Carry me away, in the eye of a hurricane
City sleeps below, and no one knows where I go
When I'm carried away, In the eye of a hurricane
I have no fear, there's a certain kind of, peace here.
Let me sleep it's, where I dream
And it all makes sense to me
What people run for cover,
But I, stand out, and shout, into the sky to
Carry me away, in the eye of a hurricane
City sleeps below, and no one knows where I go
When I'm carried away, in the eye of a hurricane
I have no fear, there's a certain kind of peace here.
You said you'd teach me, how to disappear
Bells ring out and you tried, couldn't find me here
So you kept on searching, showing the one who's lost
And I'm flying over, houses and farms and
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
Carry me away, in the eye of a hurricane
City sleeps below, and no one knows where I go
When I'm carried away, in the eye of a hurricane
I have no fear, there's a certain kind of peace here
(would you carry me away)
I have no fear
(would you carry me away)
(would you carry me away)


Don't let hurricane
Hold you back
Raging rivers and shark attack
Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away
Wrestle bears
Bring them to their knees
Steal the honey from the
Killer bees and
Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away
Don't be scared
To connect the dots
Dig for gold
In the parking lot and
Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away
Find love and give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away


Oh uh oh
Oh uh oh ooo
Fight for me
Will you fight for me
Or lie to me
And say you will
I know the game I know the drill
I'd drag it out of bars and still 
It's all I got
But that's a lot so
Fight for me
Oh uh oh
Mmhhmmm
Fight for me
Please fight for me
Can't you see
You do this to yourself
You are the hand that you've been delt
The empty room where no one's left to sing to
You are the storm rising
Hold on to the greatest balance
All I want to keep is 
What keeps on leaving
Memories fade away
Is it so wrong to wanna be here with you
Is it so wrong to wanna be here with you
Is it so wrong to wanna be here with you
In the end
In the end
I just wanna be you friend
Oh uh oh
Hey ya
Fight for me
Will you fight for me
Or lie to me and say you will


Me, can't you see, I'm as right as rain
You, you're strung out and blue, but you'll be okay.
The sun's only heightened
It's all just a game
La la la
Look me in the eye, and please take my hand
Stop avoidin' and runnin' and building your house from sand.
I wish for a wave to crash
Wash all away
La la la la la la
La la la la, la la
La la la la la la, la la la la
Me, can't you see, I'm as right as rain
You, you're strung out and blue, but you'll be okay.
The sun's only heightened
It's all just a game
La la la la


There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin, of many a poor boy
And God, I know, cuz' I'm one
My mother, was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gambling man
Down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when, he's on, a drunk
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
In the House of the Rising Sun


This year has been one crazy year,
and I've changed, that's what I feel.
I was just starting to like who I was,
Now I'm not sure who I am.
Had a dream last night, of a few years ago
sitting underneath the tree.
I was smiling wide, laughed as my brothers would fight,
over the stupid TV.
And I wish right now, that it would snow
and I wish that I was home.
Because this town really is in much. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
The city sounds like a lullaby so sweet, at least, to me.
Cuz' this town is quiet, and old to believe, doesn't feel,
like Christmas and all of me.   
And I wish right now, that it would snow
and I wish that I was home.
Because this town really is in much. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
Woah - oh- oh
Oh woah - oh- oh
And my brothers moved out just last week, and I'm scared of be lonely.
I have never been just on my own, right now I wanna go home.
And April really gets on my nerves, but I kind of miss her now. 
Cuz we're all the things, that bug me, she's the only sister I every known. 
And I wish right now, that it would snow
and I wish that I was home.
Because this town really is in much. 
I want New York, a Christmas. 
I want New York, a Christmas.


I hate your dumb tattoo
I wish you'd fly to the moon
Where there are no girls to use or screw over
I'm laughing 'cause I lied, you know
I said you sound like All Time Low
You really don't even though you try hard
You try hard
I bet you're gonna hear this song
I bet you're gonna sing along
And tell your friends how I'm obsessed with you
Ohhh
And I bet you didn't know that you sound like a girl
Every time you call me when you're drunk
And all that I wanna say is
You really suck
I hate the scar above your eye
It looks like you're on drugs
And you really need to learn to wash your hair
Overall, you're not a catch
You're just a dumbass
Bleaching your hair
Well, I hope it all falls out
And it falls out
I bet you're gonna hear this song
I bet you're gonna sing along
And tell your friends how I'm obsessed with you
Ohhh
And I bet you didn't know that you sound like a girl
Every time you call me when you're drunk
And all that I wanna say is
You really suck
Oh, and thanks for telling all your lies
'Cause now I realize
I'd rather date a rock
Oh, and thanks for the tickets to your show
I just wanted you to know
All your band mates are hotter than you
I bet you're gonna hear this song and say
"Oh my god she's so obsessed with me dude"
But no
And I bet you didn't know that you sound like a girl
Every time you call me when you're drunk
I bet you're gonna hear this song
I bet you're gonna sing along
And tell your friends how I'm obsessed with you
But no
And I bet you didn't know I talked to all the girls
That you were with when you were with me
And they said
You really suck


Walking trails, soaked by our tears
Traveling miles and miles from home
Blood still stains the ground we walked
Soaking into the roots of trees
Giving strength to mother earth
This land is not their land
Head held high above the torment
Tousands die in wars
Murdered, killed, and slaughtered
Hear the hearts of our lost warriors
Beating to the pounding drum
This ground was once ours
Now a wasteland of destruction
Polluting the waters we drink
Polluting the air we breathe
Forced in the corner suffocating
Outcasts grouping for the next to ride
Through a smoke filled remonition
Tellers of the future speaking of the new beginning
One warrior will rise to defend against this place
A killa of anybody, who goes against you and I
Thousands of souls giving him power
Anybody kills until the future is fulfilled
Through darkness light shines under the rain from the diamonds
Showering upon the same roots
Roots that we shared with blood
Let those roots bring the tree
The tree that brings truth to this beginning


[Verse 1]
Right place, right time, close call, what does it matter?
Clean get away, keepin' my dirty pockets fatter
Smooth operation, plans well thought out
Hands in the air is what I'm talkin about
No doubt call me a warrior, I'm runnin' with a hatchet
The one crazy native representin' Psychopathic
Down for the D cause the D is where I struggle
Underground, wicked shit, MOTHAFACKO![Hook x2]
Do you want that native shit?
Yes we want that native shit
Do you want that crazy shit?
Yes we want that crazy shit
Do you want that wicked shit?
Yes we want that wicked shit
Do you run with a hatchet?
Yes we run with a hatchet


[Anybody Killa]
You betta kill me or you die
40 sippin bullets fillin the sky
When Anybody Killa ride, ain't no stoppin me
Bulletproof preventin you from poppin me
Unless your targets on my face
Don't think to call yourself a G
Cause me and my heater don't like no
Set trippin hoes buggin hard in my warzone
Crack ya dome to the skull, blame it on the alcohol
Mixed it with the tylenol, and peel ya body off the wall[Chorus: x2]
You betta kill me or you die
I was put here to kill people
That's the reason that i'm alive[Anybody Killa]
Bitch, I'll kill you for ya necklace
And drag your ass behind my ride around the hood
On some "I'm just bein senseless"
And flash the brights at the cops like "Fuck y'all"
Keep ya bitches on your toes, better duck y'all
3 bullets enter into the automobile
Now ones coughin blood and the other hug the steering wheel
Now I'm peelin out down the alleyway
ABK is a killa and this killa don't play[Chorus][Anybody Killa]
Say I'm a dead man, bitch that's my homie Blaze
And we been chokin motherfuckers since the old days
See it's somethin about chokin a motherfucker out
That makes you wanna scream and shout and rip his mothafuckin soul out
Stab you in the side with a machete blade
And watch the blood trickle down like Black Cherry Kool-Aid
Cause I don't want you livin, and plus this killa high
So if you steppin, betta kill me or you fuckin die[Chorus x4]


[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
My teacher always said I wouldn't be nothin'
So I met him in the parking lot said "I'ma killer" and then I rushed him
Sometimes I feel like a nut
Runnin' through the neighborhood, tearin' shit up
Straight jackin' motherfuckers just to smoke a blunt
Sometimes I feel that my head fucked up, and it really sucks
I hear voices tellin' me to do it (Do it)
How would you act if you had to live through it?
Turnin' back on the gat, and I stole me an ounce
Now I'm addicted to the sound of a head gettin' whacked
Do I smoke too much, cause I choke too much?
Are you mad cause I keep stealin' your roaches bro
Yo Mike P! (Yo what's up?) Turn my headphones up
Rude Boy got me stoned from the sticky stuff
Weed's fuckin' with my head, man I'm too damn high
Yo Violent J, you want the rest? (Show you right!)
Man I can smell it in yo pocket (Roll it up)
Sandwich bag filled up like you ain't got enough
Always smoke with your road dogs, don't be shy
Cause when a drought comes, he might be yo main supply
Me and J steady smokin' pounds
So at least have a sack when you see us around (Biatch!)
Like you ain't heard, man we flippin' the scripts
So unlock yo ziplock and let me grab us a spliff[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
When I pass it to you, bitch pass it back
Bitches don't smoke for free, where the ass be at?
B-L-A-Z-E, ABK
And we got Esham and Violent J
Juggalos outside in the parking lot
Because y'all know how we get sparked a lot
Got the Faygo Cola with the Vodka twist
And when we all get together we see diamond mist[Verse 3: Violent J]
I could smoke a stick of dynamite and not be dead (POP!)
I like it cause it fuck with my head
I stay weeded indeed, a killa need it
I can eat it to feed it, proceed and keep it heated
Now who the fuck don't like my flow?
You ain't heard my words will make the beard of a wiseman grow
Hydro, in a good way it fuck with my head
And without it you fucks would be dead
I rhymed dead and head for the 17th time
We double team rhymes, ABK and Violent J
If I loved Shaggy anymore I'd have to be gay
In Californ-i-a, they pull they socks to they knees
NIA, Ninjas In Action we be deez
I like cheese, I'm a serial pleez
I bitch slap fans cause I be a dick like that
I get wicked-wicky-wicky rhymes sick like that
I'm fat and fuzzy and I smell like weed everywhere
My homies call me Smokey The Bear
Tell that pokey beware, don't come near here
Don't dare, unless you wanna see my axe buddy partin' your hair
I'm a Southwest gang bang gangsta boy
Zug Island, Del Ray I aint's ta toy
My boy Nate's the boy, my whole crew busts shots
Until you out like quamay's pokadots
I'm tryin' to smoke a litte somethin' for my dogs who smoke
They only cessed and stressed cause they all too broke
I'm like "bew-bew-bew-bew-bew" with the Anybody Killa
Blowin' Indian tubleweed, we bitch booty feelas
Ghetto scrubs flippin' nubs at thugs
We drown faggots in Faygo tubs and eatin' dead bugs (Ew!)
I'm tryin' to say anything that rhymes
So I can fuck with your head like the cess do mine[Hook x2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Break it down and roll it up, smokin' blunts all night
Hesitate to hit it too hard, the weed's that tight
Sticky icky situations, dehydrated
Cottonmouth creepin', the game got me faded[Verse 4: Esham]
I'm in the water with the sharks bleedin'
That's why I be a killa for no reason, speedin'
My flows dope like OZ's and
Crush pounds and trees and, I'm all season
Veteran, no one does it better than they (We)
E and J, (Hey) ABK
And that's my man and them (What's up?)
And I always blow ganj with them
Detroit playas too advanced for them
We buyin' out the bar, we don't dance with them
So if you ever get a chance to glance at them
Baby boy say holla back, answer him
H-U-S-T-L-E-R
Yes, that's what the hell we are
See, me and Blaze, wicked ways
Full body armor, 5000 rounds and about 2 K's
I can walk on water, spit fire and ice
Chinese secrets, makin' wine from rice
Still shoot dice, up against the wall so nice
Still F-U-C-K the po-lice
Think twice like the 3 blind mice
But don't give me no advice
I shine like crystals in the jewelry heist
And still pimp hoes like Heidi Floess


Motherfucker!
Get away from here
While you still have the chance
Go, run, aghhhh[Verse 1]
BLAAAAM!!! Up in the club
Eastside, hoo ride, true juggalo scrub
They know me up in valet parkin'
They know me don't be parkin' there cause they chargin'
Where the fuck these bitches at?
I be the Anybody Killa with the gitchy sack
I'ma smoke where I wanna smoke, FUCK DAT!
Snake skin Hatchet Gear with the alphabet hat, biatch
I'm ready, bring all these hoes
Sick of hood rats at party sto's
Everybody knows, I'm headin' downtown
At the Shelter, St. Andrews, underground
I want a gothic bitch, outta noir leather
To come and fuck this thug when I'm on the tether
I'm like, Cinderella cause I'm on the clock
So I'm askin' for the pussy right up on the spot
I'm like..[Skit]
What up you little freaky gothic bitch?
You ever fucked a juggalo killa before?
(Look, I have a haunted neden)
SHIT! It's all in the good, I got a haunted dick piece
Besides, it's rainin' diamonds, I ain't scurred![Verse 2]
Haunted, schmaunted
You know I like the wicked shit you ain't gotta flaunt it
Let's head to your crib, you can jibber-jab
We'll head upstairs and I'll give it a stab
She took her panties off and the door shut behind me
Oh yeah, her neden's haunted, don't remind me
Her panties were scary though, I will admit
With the tag reading WoolWorth's 1986
I almost needed a crowbar, a hammer and a pile driver
Just to get my fuckin' nub up inside her
She had bush for acres, unexplored terrain
By the time I finished cuttin' it it grew out again (Damn!)
Bend her legs back and used a wood chipper
Shaved the first half down and quickly flipped her
Ok, now spread your legs, ahhhhhhh vampire bat!
Wicked rat, bitch you got a haunted ass![Hook]
(Ya neden's haunted)
You got parasites and poltergeists
(Ya neden's haunted)
With that demon neden, you ain't right
(Ya neden's haunted)
You been fuckin' Frankenstein and them
(Ya neden's haunted)
Bitch go get that shit an exorcism[Verse 3]
Bats flyin' out of her puss, so what?
My dead homie Blaze be doin' that with his butt
I'm still fuckin her (you got a jimmy?) Do I got one?
I'm rockin' a Lumbee indian witch doctor condom
I can hump a land mine wearin' that shit
It might blow my ass up but wouldn't scratch my dick
Shit I challenge your ghost, I got ghosts of my own
So bitch open that portal I'll walk in and bring that shit home
Fuckin' this bitch was like fuckin' Anna Nicole Smith
Just a fat dumbass silly fuckin' dumb bitch
Nothin' more, nothin' less
I pulled the snappy off and I aimed for her chest
The only ghost she had right about then
Was some mysterious white orbs I left on her chin
That night I'm sleepin', givin' the dick rest
When it fuckin' came alive, my shit was possessed!
Yo nuts, we want yo nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite yo nuts
Yo nuts, we want yo nuts
Please oh, please fuck dirty butts
Yo nuts, we want yo nuts (Some of that old school)
We'll itch and scratch and bite yo nuts (Some of that 'Master)
Yo nuts, we want yo nuts
Please oh, please fuck dirty butts[Hook]
(Ya neden's haunted)
You got parasites and poltergeists
(Ya neden's haunted)
With that demon neden, you ain't right
(Ya neden's haunted)
You been fuckin' Frankenstein and them
(Ya neden's haunted)
Bitch go get that shit an exorcism
(Ya neden's haunted)
Bitch go get that shit an exorcism
(Ya neden's haunted)
Bitch go get that shit an exorcism
(Ya neden's haunted)
You been fuckin' Frankenstein and them
(Ya neden's haunted)
Bitch go get that shit an exorcism


[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
They call me ghetto neighbor, I don't give a fuck
Sounds bumpin' all night, steadily wakin' you up
Homies bangin' on the door because I'm slangin' the tree
24 hour weed spot, buy two, get one free
Every week another piece of property gettin' stolen
Check it in you little buster watch your eye get swollen
Neighborhood bad ass, I think the whole block hates me
Ready to freeze psycho motherfucker actin' crazy
Ever since the young age of 13
Same house, different neighbors and they all blame me
For all them cars that got stolen, the windows that got broken
A handful of jewelry that the cops caught me holdin' (Psyche)
I've never been caught for a run that I commited
I've never seen a fat ass lick and didn't hit it
All the murders that they claimin' I ain't stressin' that shit
Cause if you got the evidence then come convict me bitch[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Cars and stray dogs always fuckin' up my grass
And everytime you see me comin' you know I'm about to ask
Where your 5 at? I'm buyin' weed in 10 sacks
And fuck a bitch at Burger King just to get some free snacks
Standin' on my porch in a robe
I got some top tens with no shoe strings, I'm out cold
And the gold, hope it ain't nothin' my eye catch
I'm runnin' pockets like a campaign rep it's gettin' snatched
Dice game on the side of the crib
I'm shootin' dollar in this motherfucker, who else in?
And the cops got a problem with me, who knows why?
Prolly cause I got a couple tagged cars in my driveway
I keep it ghetto like the whitest of trash
Sellin' food stamps for cash just to get up on the fat pad
So when you see me on your block watch your back
Cause Monoxide will lay a motherfucker out flat[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)[Verse 3: Paris]
Who's that nigga slash Nasdaq sponsored ass?
Soldier devils never love, fuckin' up your country club
Bailin' through the gates, raisin' hatred in they eyes why
Try to calculate when niggaz make it when I ride by
Though you can't stand seein' any non-European
Havin' things, what a shame niggaz come, then you fleein'
But we won't, goodies too, take advantage, better school
Bigger plots, acre lots, pushin' Benz and sellin' stocks
Guess who comin' to dinner in your area?
Know you hate to share it, I love it when I'm scarin' the
Bitches in my neighborhood, I'm brutal on your whole committee
Never seemed to see how niggaz comin' from the city pretty
But we rollin', foldin' the cash holdin', bitch I'm showin' out
Keep my bidness out yo mouth
Clowin' all them racist holes, juggalos know a devil should
Roughest on my cul de sac, there go the neighborhood[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)[Anybody Killa]
That's right motherfucker! Psychopathic is your (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)


[Verse 1]
Where you at motherfucker heard you been talking shit
But everytime I come around it's like you seem to forget
Shut your mouth you little hoe before I scalp your lip
In other words you'll be a dead little punk ass bitch
I won't forget you every time I'm pissing over your grave
Or when I'm slanging payote in hoods that you once claimed
Learn about the tribe you're dissing cause we all ain't the same
Tomahawk steady swinging as I'm dancing for rain
So come and play with me, at least until the sky turns grey
Shooting off my arrows like AK's
Amazing situations, four colors of man, represent the wicked nations
Underground street level, running this course
Keeping you shady bitches scared to come up off your porch
So come and hang with me, unless you blaming me
Because the native hydro keeps changing me[Chorus]
Come and play with me (even if it means your death)
Though you hated me (my tomahawk swings right to left)
You bet just wait and see (I'll be a juggalo till my very last breath)
Then you hate to see (these hatchet men up on our chest)[Verse 2]
Warriors, come out and play
Roaches I spray, I'm ABK
I'd rather be dead than fade away
All my life I been a scrub, I wouldn't change a day
What I'm saying quit playing I'm a tell you how it's slaying
See me in the streets psychopathic chain just swaying
Anybody Killa so it ain't no delaying
Dead body six feet in the groud decaying
When I come I'll rub the serial numbers from my gun out
The tribal war paint on my face will make you run out
Bust shots in the sky and shoot the sun out
An keep us in the clip until every last run out
Erasing all the drama that this world brings
Moon light shine bright on shattered dreams
Keep away from a killer with a god damn fiend
Get your own fucking bullshit scheme[Chorus][Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
Twiztid Madrox and the ABK
Buying automatic weapons from renegades in Bombei
Fuck Alize and a fake ass bitch
We the sharks in the water, y'all popcorn shrimps
So you can eat my cocktail sauce and ass
Throwing east in the air when we walk past think fast
You can be a hater with a lot to say
But you're talking from the door so come out and play[Chorus: Repeat x 2]
Come and play with me (even if it means your death)
Though you hated me (my butcher knife swings right to left)
You bet just wait and see (I'll be a juggalo till my very last breath)
Then you hate to see (these hatchet men up on our chest)
These hatchet men up on our chests [until fade out]


[Verse 1]
If you ever started hating me, how would you act?
Like you never fuckin knew me and you ain't got my back
If you ever started hating me, what would you do?
Try and stab me in the back when I'm just passin through
If you ever started hating me, fuck it that's it
Let it be known that you're a hater and you're just full of shit
If you ever started hating me, then catch your stone
Underground is better livin then your mainstream home
If you ever started hating me, then take it to the streets
Detroit, Eastside 7 mile is where we'll meet
If you ever started hating me, then watch your back
You'd be surprised what hood rats would do for crack
If you ever started hating me, then keep your distance
Why the fuck would you want to be up in my business?
If you ever started hating me, it's not my fault
You just probably never liked me from the start mother fucker[Hook]
I say fuck you! and offer no apologies
For my mythologies I be just how I be
And I be wicked too, so fuck your family
If they damin' me, and don't try bannin' me
This hatchet fam insanity, how can it be uncaninly?[Verse 2]
If you ever started hating me, then don't come around
Cuz I don't think you're gonna like it if I'm beatin you down
Pistol whippin mother fuckers for the shit that they say
Like my names the only reason that I act this way
If you ever started hating me, then hold your breath
Cuz it just might be the last thing that you have left
Grabbin on to your life movin closer to death
Cuz juggalos are gettin fed up with the shit that you spread
If you ever started hating me, then bitch fuck you
If it's that way mother fucker then I hate you too
Tell your family eat a dick I hope they whole crew dies
And they never fuckin make it up to Shangri-La
If you ever started hating me, then rest in peace
Cuz all the enemies I have are pretty much deceased
Dedicated to the dark cuz their soul was never wanted
So now I pray that their afterlife is fuckin hard[Hook]
I say fuck you! and offer no apologies
For my mythologies I be just how I be
And I be wicked too, so fuck your family
If they damin' me, and don't try bannin' me
This hatchet fam insanity, how can it be uncaninly?[Verse 3]
I can't help what I feel when I write so I'ma tell it
And I hope to all the haters that this shit is spreadin
The only reason there's haters is cuz they feel left out
No life, no home cuz juggalos shut 'em out
So now they hide behind computers actin hard when they soft
I swear to god I hope they're fingers fall off
I can't stand em, to tell the truth I just don't need them around
So when I see ya I'ma teach ya how to get smacked down
If you ever started hating me, just fall off the earth
Because the soul your body carries really has no worth
Understand the situation homie hate me or not
Or it's the ? that you hate that's why your stomache's in knots
Always feeling left out cuz you don't fit in
So now you spread around this hate and still act like a friend
But time will only tell how much your hatred grows
That's why we always screamin fuck a juggaho[Hook]
I say fuck you! and offer no apologies
For my mythologies I be just how I be
And I be wicked too, so fuck your family
If they damin' me, and don't try bannin' me
This hatchet fam insanity, how can it be uncannily?


[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
I wanna know where the fuck are my down ass underground killas
Straight cap peelas
Walkin' the earth, been mean since birth
Takin' every damn thing in sight that's worth
Somebody stabbin' you in the back, for a pebble of crack
Eastside, bitches like that
Sometimes I feel that I can't eat, can't sleep
Put me in a hole baby, 6 feet deep
Better yet, just leave me alone
I've survived this long with a microphone
Roamin' the streets, mean muggin' police
Left hand on my nuts right grippin' a piece
So now I feel that I owe it to y'all
You're the reason that I'm here instead of dead and gone
And don't think that I'm here to stress you out
I just wanna let you know what I'm about[Hook x2]
Tomahawks, shotguns, axes, chains
These are all the thangs that a G brangs
To your party, birthday, wedding, funeral
Streets is crucial, competition zero[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
Face facts, do the math
You can try to relax but this killa ain't like that
Wait a minute, let me tell the truth
I'm relaxed like a motherfucka, tomahawking a fool
Walk away just keeping my cool
Like I'm sneaking in line at a big venue
No traits, no motive, nobody, no clue
Yo Blaze, am I right? (WOOP WOOP!)
That's what the fuck I've been tryin' to say
Me and my whole damn family actin' murderous ways
That's why we only gather once a year
Because the world really can't afford to disappear
So now we all break bread, never misled
And the drama that I bring you will never forget
And the ones that's down no matter where you're at
I'm just here to let you know that I got your back[Hook x2]
Tomahawks, shotguns, axes, chains
These are all the thangs that a G brangs
To your party, birthday, wedding, funeral
Streets is crucial, competition zero[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I'm hard as the come, homie don't be slippin' actin' dumb
Shove the pistol in your mouth, slightly quicker than some
The streets are talkin' I be listenin', hearin'
Reppin' for my thugs who got nothin' to be fearin'
Ask me if I ever been jacked, I've been screwed and taxed
And waxed, some suckas with two little stripes to attack
Mothafuckas ain't shit, I'm a soulja
Drag bodies into coffins, by they bitch ass shouldas
Middle name Murder, Colton Grundy the rest
You see me packin' a gun in the vest
Now do your best to stay alive, I ain't never gonna die
Eternal like the galaxy, who wanna try me?
I tell you one more time for all the foes of mine
Ain't no way, ain't anybody gonna stop my shine
Do the drive-bys bitch smackin' hoes and robberys
I do it for the streets and the money so respect me[Hook x4]
Tomahawks, shotguns, axes, chains
These are all the thangs that a G brangs
To your party, birthday, wedding, funeral
Streets is crucial, competition zero


[Verse 1]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray my dreams don't slowly creep
Caught up in a web with no escape
Something the mind can't break unless you wide awake
Have you ever had a nightmare, and been scared?
Then woke up in the morning and forgot it was there
Then the shit really happens like deja-vu
But you sit back and act like you never knew
The same situation happened in my life
And I feel that I sould tell it cause the timing is right
Now the only reason that I'm speakin' is cause I'm teachin'
Thinkin' if I let it out my head'll stop tweakin'
Mixed emotions caused from stress
That reunite when you lay your head down to rest
It's like creatures of the night leavin nothing but bad news
And things about the future that might make you confused[Verse 2]
I remember way back in the day
At the age of 13 before moms passed away
The dreams that I had people said weren't right
Like the evilness of afterlife lurkin' in the night
Candlelight blew out, bed stops shakin'
Down on my knees prayin', askin' to be taken
To another life where it's safer than this
Not a dream but reality I hope for this wish
But it never came true so I'm stuck in this place
Just a native actin' crazy that keeps changin' his face
Searchin' for the final answer so I can spread the word
Now that you really see me I'm just askin' to be heard
We all in this together, so they call us night crawlers
Think the world's feelin' weary because we gettin' smarter
Silohettes in the hallway, dead men holla
Can't sleep at night cause the spirits won't allow ya[Blaze Ya Dead Homie Talking]
You know bein' dead
I remember thinkin' death would be horrible and terrifying
Shit, I mean that's what everybody thinks
But now, having died and shit
I can now see everything
Like every question the living have, I now know the answers to
It's like I'm awake now, and living was just a dream[Verse 3]
Call me the dream catcher, mother earth smoker
Peyote pack piece pipes hallucinatin' toker
Blessed with the wisdom that you see in my eyes
Don't be surprised if you ever think you caught up inside
Like the awakaning of life, or the passion of death
That keeps you jumpin' up in shivers from ice cold breath
Now you swear you're being followed everytime that you rest
Or you feel sharp pains drillin' deep in your chest
I don't expect anyone to believe if they don't want to
But don't expect yourself to rest in peace when spirits haunt you
Make your choice people dream it or not
It's time to look into the situation we got
Pinpoint the whole problem, get rid of all the anger
Release all the stress before the world becomes a stranger
Medicine man above your headboard with a dream catcher
In the blood of the boogie man the warrior'll protect ya


[Intro: Syn]
Two seperate worlds, opposites
Yet alike in so many many ways
Both of these worlds are engaged in an eternal war with each other
The war of good versus evil, which is which, you decide
Only one thing will outlast both armies, only one thing will survive in the end
And that special magical little item is that of which we call
The hollow tip bullet[Verse 1]
Sit back and let me take you into the mind of a killa
Dark Carnival psychopathic wig spiltta (Anybody)
Move and change it's time to rearrange
So love a dinosaur that you can't tame
I bring pain, what you think I'm playin a game?
Detroit is my home, Eastside's what I claim
Fuck a balla, I represent the 313
With tech nines and green tree it's a luxury
That's how it is and I ain't changin for shit
Walk the earth mean muggin, waitin for someone to trip
I'm sick and tired of fuckin waitin for you wannabe thugs to quit
That's why I keep it underground and drop the killa shit
For juggalos that keep it real non-stop
Keep away from juggahos unitl I load up my glock
Cuz in Detroit we got mother fuckin problems
And all the gun play that you hear is my homies tryin to solve them[Hook x2]
You can't tell me anythang
Hollowpoints control the game
I can tell ya once they're triggered
Things will never be the same (Anybody Killa)[Verse 2]
I got a brand new tech that I'm dyin to use
Play games with this killa and you destined to loose
Mental stress, keepin me alive
Sniffin lines of gunpowder to start off the night
Curbside gangbanger with some mark ass bitches
Gun smoke from bullet holes leaves you dead in the ditches
I'm just an average individual, street slangin convict
Pocket full of bullets ready to use 'em up quick
You ask my name (ABK), you know the game ain't changed
Labeled as a killa bustin caps all the same
As any other mother fucker with a piece and little bit of attitude
Runnin through the streets actin rude
So hate if you want to, but I'ma keep my focus
And continue with the magic that I practice with the lotus
Psychopathic and I'm down for life
And anyone who disagree let these hollowpoints change your mind[Hook x2]
You can't tell me anythang
Hollowpoints control the game
I can tell ya once they're triggered
Things will never be the same (Anybody Killa)[Verse 3]
I feel the urge to murder, there's no need to cure me
Civilized under the light, at night I'm filled with fury
Is it true that the people who you hang with rub off?
Is that why me and Violent J love cutting bitches heads off?
Imagine everytime you woke up, you was gettin choked up
And had to grab a shank and slit a throat up
The type of shit that most people call unreal
But it's the thing that makes you feel the way to deal is just to kill
Crazy ballistic cause my head is untrained
With the empty fuckin wallet so there's so much to gain
If I appeal to you do you think I keep it real with you?
Turn your back and let my hollowpoints drill in you
What type of person do you think that I am?
Because we had a conversation and afterwards we shook hands
Don't get it in your head that I would never hurt you
Cuz the ones that gettin shot are the ones that deserve to[Hook x2]
You can't tell me anythang
Hollowpoints control the game
I can tell ya once they're triggered
Things will never be the same (Anybody Killa)


[Whispers]
If you don't know now you know, if you don't know now you now[Verse 1]
First off, let me speak
There's some crazy motherfuckers I've been dying to teach
About the ways of the underground
How it spins round and round by adding those terrifying sounds
Make your way from the East to the West
And the North and the South Juggalos hear me out
You wanna know about me well it's time for me to tell ya
But it's nothing familiar
Known on the streets as ABK
Busting caps at the strays with a rusty ass throw away
If you scared turn the lights on
I can see your heart steady pounding so I bet it won't last long
Pack the weed in the bong take a hit
And reminisce about some bullshit
That's how it is when you're out of control
A little something that I thought you should know[Chorus]
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (What)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Come On)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us (Yeah)
Tell me why the hell does everybody in this world wanna know about us[Verse 2]
Did you learn a little bit
From the rhymes that I spit
If not well it goes like this
I'm crazy, fucked in the brain
People say that I'm going insane
Because the life that I chose underneath the concrete
Deep with a dead sleep in a killer's beat
Away from the sun cause it hurts my eyes
Like a vampire only come around at night
Brand new fuck you
Blood sweat and tears now it's time for me to break through
Been such an outcast in so many ways
Now it's time to clear my head and make you all amazed
Words that I speak leave your ears infected
No need for bodyguards I'm your own protection
There's only two things that I need
My juggalo family and a bag from JD[Chorus][Bridge x14]
Do you know[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Me and ABK we be like
(Hold up man, you got too many cases on your hands)
Besides if I told you then I'd have to choke you
Chop and cut you, strangle and smoke you
Too much dirt that I can't speak on it
You think you know you dont know I put my kids on it
If it makes you think go ahead light a joint
Cause you dont know, that's the point[Chorus fade out]


[Chorus: x2]
Why you tryin to play me, foo dang? (Foo Dang)
Just cause I wanna let my nuts hang
Teeth bang on the streets servin heads all night
Some of us just ain't livin right[Blaze]
I know this stupid bitch who think she know me
She even wanna call me Blaze Her Dead Homie
Bitch keep ya mouth shut cause ya foo dang
Couldn't hold my balls, couldn't hold my wang
Stank hoes wanna see me in the grave
But I'm quick to slap a trick wit a 12 gauge
You know you was speakin my name, playin games
And sayin things you know he's actin like something changed
But I know you are reppin your fancy car
Little money, foo dangin at the tittie bar (Bitch!)
7 dicks shoved in her box nightly, is she fucking?
(Is she fuckin?) For the right price she might me
Stank hoe, I never paid for ass
So take a stray cat, and shove it in ya flat ass
Get up out my face wit that foo dang drama
Where she learn that shit? Man she get it from her mama[Some guy]
I say Foo, you say Dang
Foo (Fuck You!!)
Dang (Fuck You!!)
Someone say fa sho, yea I'm in the house
Yea I'm in the house[Chorus][Anybody Killa]
I foo dang on the daily, go ahead and call me shady
Bad boy on the streets, startin static since the '80s
So why you gotta front? Try and play me like a punk
If you keep talkin shit, you gon' end up in my trunk
Jackin beats from bustas, we foo dang like that
Robbin hoes for they gold then trade it in for a sack
Don't even think for a second that we high class
40 drinkin freaks with some dank and a nice ass
? identity with some eastside conflict
Bitches make me sick if they don't foo dang dick
Keep it real and I'll try to keep it real back
Try to trip in over all the bodies that I shot wit the gat
Hunt you down wit my automobile, roll down the window slow
Then punch you right in the throat
Type of shit that most people call a little fucked
But it's simple and plain, we foo dang, so don't front[Some guy]
Yo Killa, this Tadpole
I got ya number from this bitch I know
I was the guy followin you home from the signin ??
Yo man why you ain't pull over?
I ain't no houndog or nothin but I just[Chorus][Blaze]
Foo dang is what I call a hoe without a pistol
Walkin all alone (There she go) and if I see you it's on
I'm callin out old janky bitches wit no heart
Dogs with no bite that wanna bark
Reppin gold is like a crip wearin red in my hood
And I'll slap ya wit a bat like a G should (Beeitch!!)
Bitch, check yourself into the crackhead clinic
You can't get no ? bringin a bag wit bottles in it[Anybody Killa]
Foo dangin wit a hatchet, come and get ya ass kicked
If you bring a bottle then I really wanna smash it
Sellin weed filled wit stems and seeds
Same shit for $550 but you askin a G
Now that's the kinda shit that makes a mind go crazy
2 packs of 'Ports a day and I just can't take it
I swear if 1 more hero tries to flex in my face
I'll go foo dang around the globe and make the whole world change[Chorus]


[Violent J] Gangsta?[Anybody Killa]
Now if you got yo hat tilted to tha side
And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset
Then you might be.. GANG RELATED! (Aint nothin' wrong)[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
Never once been seen alone
ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
then you might be..
GANG RELATED! Murder rap
notches all in your belt
robbery and sellin'
trees the only jobs that you held
been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
then you might be..
GANG RELATED! In and out tha penitentiary
with no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree
still clockin' "G"s from what you learned on tha streets
then you might be..
GANG RELATED! (Aint nothin' wrong)[Chorus: x2]
You might be.. (What!? what!?)
You might be gang related![Verse 2: Violent J]
Do you wear a hatchetman?
You in a gang and yo ass better be ready to do that thang
You rep tha JRB and you will never switch
(JRB?) Juggalo Rydas Bitch!
Did you beat your girlfriends who dissed your boys
Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a "K"
Then you gang related to muthafucka like Violent J[Anybody Killa]
I'm always asked if I'm gang related
by police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free
Besides gang related's such a harsh word
for them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
the battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed[Chorus x4][Violent J]
Do you participate in gang related activities?
03's, 211's, 187's?
If you do that's okay, fuck we all do
I'm only tryin' to say you gang related too bitch!
Take Anybody Killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
you wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
but I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery
The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'Cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe[Chorus x4][Shaggy 2 Dope]
Ah ha
ha ha
ha ha ha! You know what man? You just might be!
In spite of your own knowledge of 'em
A gangsta, gangobodacious, smacksimus
Maximum boogie woogie ryda AKA gang related
You dilapidated muthafucko![Chorus continuously]
You might be...
You might be gang related! (Aint nothin' wrong)[Violent J]
You fuckin' gangbangulator!


[Verse 1]
Somewhere out on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be somethin' better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay[Chorus]
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the city lights)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (I need a blunt so I can get high)[Verse 2]
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be somethin' better
And I can't stay another night[Chorus]
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the city lights)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (I need a blunt so I can get high)


Hey, anybody wanna hear something dirty?
Well ya know, You're gonna have to help me
You know that old building, next to the Indian burial grounds?
Well word has it
There's a chest buried underneath the floor boards under the stairway there
And inside it, there's all type of dirty history
Left behind by this crazy warrior
And people say if it was ever dug up
It would bring this guy back around
Then he would spread all these messages himself
So now that I've told you all
Do you still wanna hear something dirty?
Ok, follow me
Look, there's the stairway
Come on, hurry up, let's pull up these floor boards
Look, there it is, help me pull it up
Quick, give me something to break off this lock
Cool, now help me open it up
What the!


Tell me what the fuck's goin' on ya'll?? 
We're droppin' bombs up in this bitch!! 
Tell me what's goin' on!? 
Ya'll better recognize 
Psychopathic 
DROPPIN' BOMBS!!! 
I will always keep my shit, underneath the surface 
Because the way I flow, the mainstream don't deserve this 
I'm set out to break backs on tracks, 
and scratch on all records that you spin on wax 
I'm a crazy motherfucker with pride 
And I got enough wisdom to keep my soul alive 
So grab a mic and lemme see if it shine 
Cause it's time to make this whole world mine, all mine 
Everytime I see these people 
They always just stop and stare 
Like I don't belong in this place 
So they say that it's not fair 
I can't understand this drama 
That the earth brings down on me 
So let me take you through my mind 
Look in my eyes, follow me [Chorus 2x]
Tell me 
What's going on 
and drop these bombs on you 
I'm gonna tell you why I'm droppin' bombs 
Because I'm sick and fuckin' tired of seeing fire alarms 
Little explosions, marshmallows roasting 
Soft motherfuckers standing on the stage boasting 
Now don't expect me to just walk away 
Because I've been told ya'll that I'm here to stay 
I'ma still keep flowing, from coast to coast 
And I'ma still keep smoking weed with juggalos 
I'ma still bust caps, at all these hoes 
And I'mma drop me a bomb off, at every show 
That's how it is, so just grab your bow 
Because it's time to represent 
and watch these warriors grow 
I can't understand this drama 
That the Earth brings down on me 
So let me take you through my mind 
Look in my eyes, follow me [Chorus 2x]
Tell me 
What's going on 
and drop these bombs on you


[Violent J]
Mop up the floor with that bullshit 
Cause I'mma stick and move 
I'mma stick and move anybody 
Do anything 
to get what I need 
To take care of me and mine [Anybody Killa]
Stick and move, outta the way 
Duck ya head, time to pray 
I'm lookin' for anyone who ever doubted 
See me in the streets if ya wanna talk about it 
These days I got nothing but time 
So I'm gonna use it all to chase down what's mine 
Actin' crazy when you know you're soft 
And the only thing hard is that shit you talk 
You ever seen a redskin get tipsy 
Then take it to the old school 1850 
Arrow stuck in the back of ya neck 
Just because ya mama raised you to disrespect 
New game means whole new rules 
And I guarantee ya'll that I will not lose 
I guess I'm gonna take ya back to my roots 
Warriors stand up and let's get these fools [Chorus]
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Don't let no one get ya 
Ha ha! That's what I'm talkin' about 
Stick and move like a heavyweight knockin' you out 
What you thinkin' about 
when you runnin' your mouth 
Tellin' people that you know me like you live in my house 
Things like that, I won't take 
I'mma grown ass man ya best get that straight 
All I do is roll state to state 
So I can look into the eyes of those who relate 
So if you comin' with me then let's go 
We gonna make it more hype than the night before 
Just a bit more out of control 
So learn to live a little and watch your life grow 
Don't mean to steer you wrong 
But when you're livin' in the ghetto, life don't seem long 
Stick and move, move and stick 
Cause second chances don't come that quick [Chorus]
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Don't let no one get ya 
Come stick and move with me 
right through the industry 
come stick and move with me 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Let's say this was a game of tag 
Will ya hide and go get whatever made ya mad? 
I see you, can you see me? 
Even though I stick and move through the industry 
Skip back, play it again 
We should all represent our race 
Open your eyes, cause what you want 
Is staring you right in your face [Chorus]
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Left to right 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Stick and move 
Don't let no one get ya


[Anybody Killa]
How ya doin'? It's me again! 
Underneath the concrete 
Sewage of the underworld, where the fuckin' dead sleep 
Creepin' and crawlin' with the stench of a rat 
Hear me when I'm comin' but ya don't know where I'm at 
Never seen in the daylight, only in the nighttime 
Huntin' for me something that can increase my lifeline 
I see it all, dead bodies and such 
Ghetto gators goin' crazy when they haven't had they lunch 
The more I kill, the bigger they get 
It's like two Hannibal cannibals and one biscuit 
Who's to blame that my parents hated me 
And put me in the sewer cause they knew I couldn't reach 
Seems like I was there for years 
Before I grew a little bigger and I gave em both a scare 
Now I'm addicted to payin' people back 
Sittin' underneath the sewer caps 
and waitin' for you to pass [Chorus]
Down here 
There ain't no light, 
Might not be alright 
Down here 
In these sewers and pipes 
It's always night 
Down here 
There's no sunlight I'm feelin' 
Down here 
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin' 
Appealin' [Violent J]
Sometimes the tunnels get so small 
I have to army crawl 
My way through 
Can you relate to that? 
I can see up ladies skirts 
on their way to work 
Just for a second 
I see they booty and neden 
Tell 'em Killa [Anybody Killa]
Come and visit us I know it's somewhere that you wanna be 
Gettin' dirty life of no luxury 
Even though this road is so swervy 
This place is still home to me [Chorus]
Down here 
There ain't no light, 
Might not be alright 
Down here 
In these sewers and pipes 
It's always night 
Down here 
There's no sunlight I'm feelin' 
Down here 
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin' 
Appealin' [Violent J]
It's always nighttime 
In the pipelines 
I sit in the sewage waistdeep and write rhymes 
I know these sewers 
And which ones are the newest 
And which ones be some underground transit movers 
We like Swamp Thing, down here, damn near 
They throw homeless people in, stab 'em, 
cook 'em right there 
I can dive, roll, somersault, tunnel crawl, spring 
I been bitten by so many fuckin' rats it ain't a thing 
I love this, I crawl through your housepipes 
I'm hiding in your shower nozzle pissin' on your wife 
People down here are hungry, they eat muthafuckas 
Everybody's alone, they always eatin' each other 
I came crawlin' out the toilet, into somebody's john 
I walked out and the family started screamin', it was on 
I ran for the fridge and grabbed everything I could 
And then dove in through the kitchen sink 
and back to tha hood 
I met a hooker down here, ya think they bad up there 
This bitch ain't even have a neden left anywhere 
Just a big hole with nothing in the middle 
Her ugly ass titties had a rat hangin' and chewin' 
off of each nipple 
Runnin' through the dark maze, I know my way 
I know no days, only glowing rays 
Beaming through the sewer hole lids of the streets 
Certain parts, but them parts certainly ain't for me [Chorus]
Down here 
There ain't no light, 
Might not be alright 
Down here 
In these sewers and pipes 
It's always night 
Down here 
There's no sunlight I'm feelin' 
Down here 
Ya have to crawl and find it all appealin' 
Appealin' [Repeat 4x]
There's no sunlight 
There's no sunlight 
Down Here


Diiiiirrrrrrrty!! 
My gat sounds nice 
One 
Leave your whole damn neighborhood stunned 
You better run 
I'm comin' at ya 
Duck, bob, and weave as these bullets fly past ya 
Man I'm crazy 
Puffin' on a green leaf 
Pointin' my heat 
Straight get off on bein' the street 
I'm puttin' 
One little 
Two little 
Three little holes in the back of ya dome 
You shoulda stayed home 
D-Town born and raised 
Drinkin' on a porch 
Beatin' down on strays 
Broke as fuck 
and always hungry 
Clothes on my back be dirty laundry [Chorus 2x]
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Those who grip a mic are known as teachers 
I'm dusty like a ashtray 
I don't give a shit 
Got a clean ass piece though 
With a full clip 
and a small axe underneath the passenger seat 
Ready to swing it 
Best believe I'mma bring it 
Who you think ya messin' with, don't trip 
I'm a warrior 
Scalpin' all those who ain't standin on the same side 
When its all about to go down 
Fightin' with the enemy 
Puttin' them in the ground 
I bring that old school basement sound 
When all I had was a forty-five weighin' me down 
Little redskin homey in the hood 
Big pimpin' 
Ghetto fabulous in the booth bullshittin' [Chorus 2x]
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Just give me a fuckin beat 
Those who grip a mic are known as teachers 
"Yeah man, my girl supposed to be comin' through dog 
and uh, she might just have a little hunny for you." 
"Hey man" 
"What?" 
"Is it always like this in your motherfuckin' neighborhood, dog?" 
"What, What? Oh, man it get crazier on the weekends dog." 
"What the fuck man....." 
"Lets go down to the party store I know that bitch down there. I need a forty anyway dog." 
"Go to the fuckin....Whatchu gotta a tan....What you you gotta tank in the back mother fucker?!" 
"Oh man, it's just down the street, come on dog!" 
"Fuck that, I ain't goin to no mother fuckin, fuck that 
where the basement at?" 
"Oh man....."


[Anybody Killa]
There's a party goin' on, who's comin' with? 
To kill the rest of that warm 40, and grab ya shit 
I hope you got some money, cause I ain't got your back 
Especially how cheap you was on the chronic sack 
There's a party at the liqour store, 
don't be claimin' broke 
Actin' like a cold 40 ain't good on the throat 
Who you think that you foolin'? Cause it sure ain't me 
Should'a borrowed five dollars from your old lady 
Is there anybody's cup as empty as mine? 
Pile into the Hoo-ride, seats recline 
Stop at the weedspot, order up another 
This is how we do it, MUTHAFUCKA 
CD burned full of old school tracks 
On the corner of the party store shootin' some craps 
If this is something that you normally see 
then you probably live close to me [Chorus]
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party 
Anybody! 
Party 
Everybody! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! [Colton Grundy]
I showed up, showed up 
Khaki's creased 
And a chicken head hangin' on either side of me 
Sendin' me to the store 
To cop some 40s 
And I take my time, and make my way around the party 
See my boy JD, and the weedspot on wheels 
65 Impala, drop top, and make the shit hop 
Come on out, sparks the blunt, with two bitches 
Then came through the skunk, we got fucked up! 
Seconds passed, the chicken heads came back 
Now it's off to minglin' and see who else up in the shack 
The music started bumpin', there ain't no sign of the pigs 
If there was, I'd pull my shit and split they fuckin' wigs 
I'm high as fuck, and stumblin' off six 40s 
By the time I see my homie, ABK, up at the party 
Chillin' with seven hoes and they sell toes 
Or they dream about sex and those in birthday clothes [Chorus]
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! 
There was a party 
Anybody! 
Party 
Everybody! 
There was a party at the liquor store 
C'mon! [Anbody Killa]
When I got there, shit was tight 
So I rolled up a blunt of that chocolate tie 
Everybody was chillin' out front, sayin' "What's up?" 
Walk in to grab a 40 as I spark my stuff 
Went straight to the back where the brew be at 
Grabbed a cold 4-0 and proceeded to crack 
Gotta dollar fifty sub and a bag of Better Made chips 
Phone number from the hot bottle return bitch 
It was a good day, perfet day to party 
Hot bangin' bootyliscious freaks actin' horny 
Man, this party store is kinda like the club 
Besides the bums comin' in, cause the beer's cheap enough 
I was gettin' my groove on, big straight pimpin' 
Aisle of the party store, Bud Light sippin' 
I heard a gunshot, my drink dropped 
I coulda swore it was the fuckin' cops [Robbery noises][Chorus]
There was a robbery at the liquor store 
What happened?! 
There was a robbery at the liquor store 
What happened?! 
There was a robbery 
A robbery? 
Someone got shot 
He got shot?! 
There was a robbery at the liquor store 
What happened?!


Hey ya'll 
Come over here, check this out 
And gimme a minute of your time, but don't doubt 
Anything that I tell ya'll, listen up closely 
It's something ghostly, my ancestors told me 
Way back before we walked the earth 
It was so much cleaner cause it wasn't disturbed 
But there was still hatred and strugglin' for our color 
Cause if you had nothing you were bound to smother 
And I don't know why, cause helping hands should be a must 
It was written on the manuscript, in the book you trust 
Unless it's all just a way to get us arguin' 
Believe what you feel, even if it's a life of sin [Chorus 2x]
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta watch they back 
We alone, so watch your back 
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta walk in they own path 
But at the end, you can't go back 
Ever since there's been a jail cell 
Murder's been committed 
Thou shalt not kill, and who's the one sinnin'? 
At the end of all of this, will they be judged? 
Punished for the life they took with no grudge 
Nowadays, things sure ain't changed 
There's a whole lot of states allowed to fry your brains 
That's cause lately we just burn it away 
Let them build they own prisons where their ass can stay 
It's a wonder how we let things happen 
I ain't special 
But I enjoy takin' it to another level 
Bad choices lead to a terrible afterlife 
So, just learn your wrongs from right [Chorus 2x]
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta watch they back 
We alone, so watch your back 
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta walk in they own path 
But at the end, you can't go back 
Hey ya'll 
I don't mean to get ya thinkin' about 
Things that's gonna get ya down and out 
There just things I had to get up off my chest 
Cause I'm trying to relax and just do my best 
I don't wanna take a situation, and turn it upside down 
I just feel this world's fuckin' around 
I mean, who am I to judge? 
I just, I was raised to be strong enough 
Hey ya'll 
Do you understand what I'm saying? 
Hey ya'll 
My ancestors got me down on my knees prayin' 
Hey ya'll 
They keep tellin' me to spread the word 
Hey ya'll 
Cause when they come their gonna test what you have learned [Chorus 2x]
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta watch they back 
We alone, so watch your back 
Hey ya'll 
Everybody gotta walk in they own path 
But at the end, you can't go back 
Hey ya'll 
Hey ya'll! 
Retaliation, what now bitch!!


[Anybody Killa]
Retalition is a must 
Watch your back 
Stay on que 
Shoulda never fucked with us 
Now you got me after you 
Devious and beady eyes 
Quick to jump and take your life 
What the hell you think this is? 
Ain't no way you walkin' by 
If you see them 
Let them know 
Just how far you lettin' shit go 
You fuckin with some OG 
Detroit weirdos 
We bombin' on who ever dirty situation chasin' 
and makin' you fuckin' bleed 
Put you on a permanent vacation 
Hammertime on your face with my right boot 
For loose river dance 
Do the jit into a spongy spit 
My homies Twiztid got you listed 
Have you all hemmed up like 
"What the fuck is this?" 
We bigger than you thought 
The whole crew be representin' 
Pistol whippin all haters 
Have em twitchin' and flippin' 
Retalition 
Beat em down 
Call up all the fellas 
We been known in the hood 
As some eye ball swellers [Chorus 4x]
Retaliate 
Hunt em down 
Get em where it hurts [Monoxide Child]
I'm in the back with the windows cracked 
I heard shots 
Somebody on the side of me 
Bitch I ain't Pac 
Give me a second to shoot back 
and I just happened to be smokin' a blunt 
and got the hops on my lap 
Now I'm pullin' up behind you 
Steady trying to hide out in traffic 
But you know that I'mma find you 
Blindside you 
Scared to death 
Keep shootin' till the burned and fallin' skin on his chest 
God bless the dead 
Go against me and you'll rest up in a bed 
With a hole in the head 
Don't fuck with me 
It ain't worth your life 
It ain't worth watchin' your moms die tonight 
If you start it I'mma finish it 
Diminish it to nothin' but rubble 
and you just opened a trunk of some trouble 
It's Monoxide, a killer 
Roll it up and relax 
Retaliatin' on you bitches 
Watch your back [Chorus 4x]
Retaliate 
Hunt em down 
Get em where it hurts [Jamie Madrox]
Ain't nobody playin' bitch 
This ain't no motherfuckin' game 
You fuck with ours 
You ain't never gonna be the same again 
Leave you chillin' in a wheel chair 
K chopped your legs from knee down 
Now who you gon' see now? 
You touch ours 
Get touched back with force 
Anywhere you at it's on, of course 
We don't sleep at all 
Give all my homies a call 
Everybody in your crew is sure to fall 
Sho 'Nuff! 
Retalition in effect 
Fuck with ABK and my brother 
You get a rusty shovel all up in your neck 
Use the same weapon to bury that ass in the ground 
So don't play hard 
Put your piece down 
or get peaced out 
Don't be staring like you gonna do shit 
Without your weapon and your mouth 
Bitch you're useless 
My crew gets pissed the fuck off 
At all these mediocre thugs 
Claimin' they hard 
When they be soft [Chorus 4x]
Retaliate 
Hunt em down 
Get em where it hurts 
You ever think about Death? 
You ever look Death in his eyes?


You ever chase after Death? 
People chase after Death everyday 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 
And don't even realize 
But watch out, watch out, ya never know when it's gonna 
chase after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) [Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 
Bet ya never seen us coming, while you was just chillin' 
Overnight sounds so dark and thrillin' 
With the quickness 
I bring the sickness 
Run hurry hurry run 
Ya really got to feel this 
To the outside we look ungifted 
But look deeper into yourself and prove your own existence 
Treat me like I'm unfree 
When neighborhoods are burnin' down to the third degree 
To visualize is my own teepee 
Because the hate we try to stop all began with me 
Reincarnation, like it or not 
But when you at Death's door we gonna see what you got 
Standing up on that platform 
Mad as hell cause you was never well informed 
I guarantee you're gonna wanna come back 
With a whole new life that's so compact [Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 
I've been chasin' but you couldn't tell 
You've been hidin' but I guess you fell 
Now, it's something that you gotta deal with 
Six feet deep all sleep for you, kid 
I can't stop chasin' 
Don't know what I'm facin' 
Everytime I turn around 
I'm chasin' after you 
Could this be all I am? 
A trapped soul in the shell of a man? 
No one would ever understand 
But I guess that was the plan 
So I guess I'm gonna try and relax 
And only lay down straight up facts 
Is there anyone out there that sees what I see 
Passed on life tryin' to reach me? [Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 
Why do we feel how we feel inside? 
You ever think about when it's time to die? 
Not knowin' when 
Not knowin' how 
Quittin' like a coward takin' yourself out 
Livin' life chasin' after Death 
Ya never know how much time is left 
Sure glad I can depend on ya'll 
Pickin' me up when I start to fall 
Never makin' me feel left out 
So I swear to the earth I'll never let ya doubt 
That I, don't feel the same way inside 
Take a good look into a killa's eyes 
I'm told everywhere I go 
that I'm held cause of my technique 
So take ya time, and listen real slow 
Cause these words are deep that I speak 
Listen up, listen up [Chorus 2x]
I ran through the trees and the woods 
chasing after you, chasing after you 
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming) 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
Chasing after you 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
And you never seen it coming 
Chasing after you

Stay up off it! [Anybody Killa]
Quit frontin' 
Actin' like I don't know what you up to 
I see right through you 
So what you gonna do? 
Never will you step a foot around me again 
'Cause hangin' with you I can't win 
Some of the people in this world is some straight up hoes 
Brown nose, I suppose, that's how it goes 
But I sit back watchin', clockin' dollars 
With a smirk on my face waitin' for you to holla 
So I can say nevehoe, nope, what you thinkin'? 
All up in my face, tryna thug, breath stinkin' 
You can get the barrel from my homey, Shaggy's shotgun 
All up in your face in case ya wanna taste a hot one 
I got no love for them marks 
Punks, hoes, snitches 
Grown ass bitches 
So stay away and don't come to close 
'Cause you never know who may wanna come and slit ya throat [Chorus 2x]
Nevehoe 
You ain't gettin' shit 
Nevehoe 
Nevehoe 
Stay up off it! [Shaggy 2 Dope]
I can't stand a muthafucka like you 
When my pockets in mind, I don't care what you into 
I got too many mouths to feeds from kids to mothers 
My wife and brothers and too many others 
See I'm being tryin' to speak on 
while you sit back and see me as a jar of Grey Poupon 
I should'a just stuck my dick in your mouth 
Gave your eyes chocolate donuts and bounced the fuck out 
I go home and meditate with some sage 
Tryna brush off these forked tongues like back in the day 
But your new name is vittle fingers 
'Cause your a bank account raper tryin' to steal my dinners 
Just another undercover crackhead 
It comes down to you ain't rapin' me again 
Nevehoe, bitch, for now and nevermore 
Just get your hands out my cookie jar you fuckin' whore [Chorus 4x]
Nevehoe 
You ain't gettin' shit 
Nevehoe 
Nevehoe 
Stay up off it! [Anybody Killa]
Nevehoe, not no mo' 
'Cause all your true colors are startin' to show 
Greedy ass, hand in the cookie jar 
Tryna get a fistful but it's just too hard 
Let me catch you again, I thought I said never 
Tryna take what's mine but you ain't that clever 
Runnin' with a hatchet 
Psychopathic 
We don't stop, so you gets no cream of our crop [Shaggy 2 Dope]
Twelve years in this game, for what? 
So you can a bank teller out my butt, BITCH! 
Now fuck that, it's time for some chokin' 
Crackin' those legs open, 'cause your drunk and smokin' 
Spittin' out babies like your spit your game 
Shitloads of money in fifteen minutes of fame 
Nevehoe, no, I ain't the one 
I don't pack one, but I do got a gun [Chorus 4x]
Nevehoe 
You ain't gettin' shit 
Nevehoe 
Nevehoe 
Stay up off it! 
What, what..? Bring that shit in bitch, what?!.. 
(Stay up off it!) 
Man, don't even touch my weed, dog I will bust that lip..(Stay up off it!) 
Don't, don't, don't...you ain't gettin' no ride, fuck you, you ain't got no gas money (Stay up
off it!) 
Naw, hoe don't even fuckin' worry about my bank account bitch! 
(Stay up off it!)


A mind is a terrible thing to waste 
High school reunion wouldn't show my face 
I was always looked at a little different 
And I got blamed for everything, 
even if I ain't do the shit 
It was hectic, a total fuckin' nightmare 
A room full of preps, and one thug with braided hair 
Runnin' through the halls screamin' "Fuck all ya'll!" 
Brass knuckle punch jackin' all jock's jaws 
Insane in the cranium, people always starin' 
Pointin' at me, laughin' close enough 
so I can hear 'em 
Until the day that I got my revenge 
When they found one student stabbed to death with a pen 
Whole school goin' through some emotional stress 
Gotta half day off cause of that bullshit 
Let me take another victim see if I can get a whole day 
Remember that bitch Lisa? 
They just found her in the hallway 
I ain't playin' no more, stop laughin' 
'Cause all that chit-chattin' as got this killa crackin' 
Teacher's pet, bullethole in ya chest 
Whole football team damn near layed to rest 
Half the students missin', and no one knows shit 
They haven't got a clue that it was all me, bitch 
Higher education learn a little something ya'self 
Who's next to be got, not too many left 
I'm so glad this year's almost over 
And maybe next year, before they laugh, 
they'll look over the shoulder 
New students comin' in, I'mma still be in the same grade 
Murder after murder all the way until I graduate 
Crazy killa, crazy killa's what they call me 
No evidence, but I'm still the number one suspect 
Never once was invited to a party 
And if I ever was, all I'd do is bring bloodshed [Chorus 2x]
They don't like me 
They don't want me 
Ever since I got here 
They treated me strange 
They got me going crazy 
Ain't nobody feelin' my pain 
Shed no more tears 
So many years, my head's been clear 
But now I understand 
to make all those around fear [Repeat 25x until end, through all the chaotic sounds]
They're all gonna laugh at you!


[Anybody Killa]
It doesn't matter what you say anymore, 
Things you do don't amaze me 
so, now I see you like you passed on 
Don't nothing last long, shit ain't forever 
Whatever you thinkin' of, 
there's always something ten times better 
Don't mean to bust your bubble, sink your boat 
But if you dive in, and can't swim, you ain't gonna float 
It's like, some people try as hard as they can 
to fit in a situation they don't understand 
Confused and fed up and don't know what else to do 
Until they get mad enough and come after you 
I wanna, take this time to figure out what I'm all about 
Should I do 'em in, or just chill and shut my mouth 
God forgive me for this evil takin' over 
But there's situations I won't understand until I'm older 
Gotta, live my life through these twists and turns 
And it doesn't matter cause I'm always down to learn 
It doesn't matter! [Chorus 2x]
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain 
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth 
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same 
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames [Anybody Killa]
Different lifestyle, new face each day 
Unplug yo' mind with words I say 
No choice don't move, think hard what's next 
Didn't respond quick enough, ain't no time left 
And if there was it wouldn't matter, 
Nothing matters where I'm from 
Center of the earth with the worms and scum 
Ya don't want none of this bitch, keep on steppin' 
All that drama that you bring with your mouth as a weapon 
Ain't no one ever told you talkin' shit don't pay 
The only thing that you get is the killa in your hallway 
Lookin' to revert everything that you said 
Turnin' your whole room red, bloody carpet, the bed 
I can see a lot clearer now, than where I'm headed 
There is no hate, do or die, 
To try and keep my head straight 
The more you think about me the sadder you're gonna get 
But now it's done and over, so I guess it doesn't matter 
Bitch! [Chorus 2x]
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain 
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth 
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same 
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames [Colton Grundy]
I know that they don't like and it don't matter none 
I'mma keep actin' a fool, reppin' the shotgun 
Somebody come and kill me, nothin' else seems to work 
Got me jabbin' this pen in my heart for every perk 
With my blood on it, I'm bleedin' on the track 
You can hear me lose a lung if you listen to the playback 
It don't matter, cause nobody's listenin' 
I am, start to finish, bitch, peep the manuscripts 
Ya see, if where I'm from, from the pigs where we lived 
When we buckin' at the precinct and the judge from the jail 
Throwin' the hatchet up with ABK and the fam 
Rockin' throwbacks Psychopathic, where it all began 
It don't matter how I got here or where I come from 
I still be standing in the aftermath of devastation 
Fuck everybody who don't wanna hear me 
Maybe it's what I say and portray is why they fear me 
It doesn't matter [Chorus 2x]
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain 
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got that eighth 
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same 
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames


[Chorus]
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no muthafucka, suck up that lip! 
Beause I'm back in this bitch and I'm ready to trip! 
So I hope u never doubted me, cause here I am 
Packed in ya eardrum, like a can of Spam 
And I wouldn't give a damn if u hated me now 
Because my family hears me out and bumps this shit out loud 
You can call us psycho, crazy, insane, with no one to blame 
So we just sit in the rain 
Waitin for the right day to get what we deserve 
Like respect from the cops on the curb at the concert 
Nice titties, my oh my, but when that tear gas fire 
You better close your eyes 
Every time a new adventure, punch a horse in the face 
Smoke a blunt blunt in the forest while you piss in the lake 
Situations fucked up, fun and foul 
But it's a whole new year so try and stop me now [Chorus]
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Do you believe in what you do? 
Don't stop, don't let no one hold you 
Back from what you really wanna do 
Besides in this life all you got is you 
Keep your mind clear (Keep your mind clear) 
Don't let go...go...go... So emotional 
Believe me...I know!! [Chorus]
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
You can't hold me back, because I'm comin' full throttle 
Hand on my hatchet, who wanna see a head bobble? 
I see my streets, like it's a native warfield 
And I'm the only red-skin left, standing with no shield 
So I started to chop cause I can't stop 
Its looking too peaceful up there on the top 
So I'm, doing everything that I must 
Even if I gotta bust on the ones I can't trust 
Ain't nothing hold me back! 
Ain't nothing stopping me from takin whats mine! 
(You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me!) 
Ain't nothing hold me back! 
Ain't nothing stopping me from takin whats mine! 
(You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me! You Can't Stop Me!) [Chorus repeats until end]
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now! 
Oh no! Oh, oh oh oh no! 
Ain't nothin holdin me back now, holding me back now!


[First Chorus]
Charlie Brown, please, don't come around 
Because your weed is doodoo brown 
and it smells like the ground 
You're still my homie (but no more bammer) 
But with that weed you don't know me 
When I inhale this, the staleness creeps up on me 
I love weed, especially when it gets me gaspin' 
Coughin' up a lung from that passion 
Graspin' onto life with every hit that I take 
When I'm high, is the only time I feel awake 
Roll it up, bags on reserve is what I deserve 
No joke I gots to smoke cause it calms my nerves 
And if Charlie was around I guarantee a tragedy 
From his dirt, brown weed means head starts to hurt 
Call me a high on, red eyed zombie 
smelling like oak with a twist of pine tree 
And fuck Smokey, my names Big Inhale 
And I'm known to take it down to the tail, 
You know what I mean? 
Resi-res build up on my fingernail 
Clam baked inside the soundproof Lotus Pod cell 
Lettin' out, when I'm blessed to give 
So, pass it back and let me get another hit 
Big Smoker [Second Chorus]
Charlie, Charlie 
Your weed is so sorry (mmm mmm mmmm) 
You must have grown it in a dusty safari 
I just can't smoke that no mo' 
Even though I'm broke and I'm po' 
I smell that shit in your bag, 
I choke and run for the do' 
Don't hate you, Charlie 
And homie, you still my boy 
Just keep that junk on your spot 
(Don't bring it 'round here) 
And homie, you still my boy 
Cause that I can't never handle 
I need to be high 
So stay the fuck off my block 
and don't come back on my side 
Charlie, Charlie (Charlie Brown) 
You just ain't fresh anymore 
Because I like to be lifted 
Your shit grounds me to the floor 
Don't make me deck you, Charlie (Bitch) 
Don't come 'round with that 
Don't nobody want to hit that 
Ya'll bustas need to quit that 
Charlie, Charlie


I put my life on my music and everything around me 
Streets that I was raised on, livin' on so ruggedly 
So I decided way back in the day 
That I'm gonna try and take whateva comes my way 
You know, by workin' hard to get mine, payin' dues 
Tryna make it through, and outsmart some fools 
It's been a long time since I got to sit up straight 
So best believe I'mma snatchin' off plates [Chorus]
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my...Once I put my... 
Once I put my..Once I put my) 
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee) 
I been in this game for so many years 
with no fears, cause my head is clear 
I can see you always tryna hate, on what I'm doin' 
but you will never stop, what I'm pursuin' 
Man, I got heart so fuck havin' enemies 
Take it to the stage, and I'll make you just a memory 
I put my life on every word that I say 
My guarantee is that I'm here to stay 
(So watch for me!) [Chorus]
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my...Once I put my... 
Once I put my..Once I put my) 
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee) 
Mixed tapes, and bootlegs been through it all 
In for the long haul, follow me ya'll!! 
Put your hands up if you're down for the struggle 
Cause it's time to push through this rubble 
UH! 
I got one thing on my mind, willing to grind 
both feet on the ladder, and I'm ready to climb 
Too many mouths to feed, so you gots to believe 
that I put my whole life on what the fuck I achieve 
(and that's my life!) [Chorus]
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my...Once I put my... 
Once I put my..Once I put my) 
Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee 
(Once I put my life on this 
there's nothing left but my guarantee)


[Chorus]
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 
As I sit back and think 'bout what to do next 
I start to reminisce about my life and shit 
Like how I came from the streets 
Was raised by the streets 
That's why I give love and I'll die for the streets 
I really can't help how I feel 
And I can give two fucks to know how to deal 
With the pain and anger, stress, emotions 
I just roll a blunt, light it up and start smokin' 
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin' it 
And start blastin' at phones and shit 
That's why I'm fully equipped 
with the hollowtip, so bitches don't slip 
I can't help all the things I do 
(I can't help it!) 
I gotta feelin' neither can you 
(I can't help it!) [Chorus]
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 
I can't help if I'm crazy, or just insane 
I can't help if the words I speak cause pain 
Ya gotta..keep ya cool, and say (I CAN'T HELP IT!) 
Rearrange, time will change (FUCK IT!!) 
Deal with it, face ya'self 
I can't help if my mind's taking o-over 
Brace ya'self, there's no time left 
my soul is gettin' clooo-ser 
Stay away if you can't stand the heat 
Cause when the mike's off, I'm corruptin' the streets 
Brown paper bag wrapped around my drink 
Eyes wide open, I can't help to blink 
Why do you talk that way? 
Say all those things you say 
Those rumors you create, I bet you can't help it [Chorus]
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) 
I said I couldn't help it, so leave me alone 
Why you askin'? Quit harrassin'! 
Too paranoid to pick up the phone 
Home alone all day dustin' off the chrome 
What am I supposed to do? 
When everytime I turn around I got to deal with fools 
It's like I gotta bend all the rules 
to try to take what's mine even if I lose 
Why you never make it to work on time? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why you smoke all the weed if you knew it was mine? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why you always start shit right before you leave? 
(I can't help it!) 
I guess fuckin' up comes naturally? [Chorus]
What's with the self-inflicted pain? 
(I can't help it!) 
How come everytime I see you around you act strange? 
(I can't help it!) 
Why do you trip at the sight of a hater? 
(I can't help it!) 
And then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor? 
(I can't help it!) [Repeat x2]
It's ain't my fault that I was raised this way 
Never meant to cause you pain 
Only thing that I could say is 
I apologize!!!


[Repeat x2]
Do I really wanna see so clear
even though I know bad things might appear
Tell me that it's not a waste of time
To ride around and stare up here to try and clear my mind
I was asked this question, not too far back
"Did you ever think that you would be where you at?"
Small child, state of mind, knew I would
plus the sound of the drum from the wind felt good
Place and time, though, it chose me
gave a scrub mad love, now we all family
No backs, never, I won't turn
don't act like my soul ain't concerned
about, if you like me, if you hate me,
when I die, will they take me someone tell me
if I see you all another day
Like I never would be flippin' the script
with these livewire lips that ignite with spit[Chorus]
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
What I'm ah..bout to say, some might hate
some might feel, that I'm keepin' it real
if I...drop the steel, and grab the axe
cut down trees just to clear a path
Try to show ya'll wrong from right
a down state of mind means too uptight
Think positive, better opportunities
Red, yellow, black, and white, muhfuckin' unity
You ain't foolin' me, Ain't nobody schoolin' me
Graduated from the streets of Ghetto University
Most people can't deal with this
so quick to grab a pistol cause they too damn pissed[Chorus]
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Dirty History, it's all the same
ain' no livin' soul gonna take the blame
For all the suicidal things I did
all the pain that was caused to acheive a wish
Suffering, body recovering
Struggling, when things start bubbling
Can't wash away what's not seen
guess we all gotta little dirty history
Eeeny meeny miney moe
made this killa mad now we outta control
Don't know which way to go
time to pick up the pace and let the whole world know[Chorus 2x]
I'm writing this as if it was my last
Thank you for the memories and times we had
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)
Remember me as if I never went away
Because I see you all another day
(2 Whom This May Concern)
2 Whom This May Concern
(2 Whom This May Concern)


As these words are turning I keep thinking this will never end.
At times I get lonely and I need someone to confide in.
Always under pressure and I never take time to relax.
Sometimes I just wish I could collapse.
But then I'd miss you.
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
I try to focus and just handle things that come my way.
Don't let shit get to me 'cause there will always be another day.
Maintain my emotions if I don't then I'll be sure to fall.
And I'll be damned to let myself desaulve. So you better get used to me.
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
These nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer.
When will it end? Even though I really don't want it to.
These nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer.
When will it end? Even though I really don't want it to.
These nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer.
When will it end? Even though I really don't want it to.
These night are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer.
When will it end? Even though I really don't want it to.
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Why do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me.
Why do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?
Or is it all just built in my head [x4]


Roll, Roll, wooo
Hey, ho (hey, ho)
I'm always out of control
Steady moving this is how we roll
Only streets know where we go
Cause I ain't got to stay in one place[ABK]
The wheels on a bus go round and round
Smokin' different weed from town to town

Have it rolled up cause you know how I love them blunts[Esham]
Man, I got 10's and 20's whatever you need

Back on the streets with a new release
Road Fools all day man fuck the police (fuck 'em)
Let's go, let's go is what we be thinkin' (let's go)
Back to the hotel so we can start drinkin'
You know this night has just begin
Road Folls in this bitch call a friend (holla back)
Don't be nervous just relax

[Chorus:]
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve
Nobody knows what I'm going to do next
Ain't no tellin' what's up my sleeve[Anybody Killa:]
Watch out! Hey, something's lurking, staring right at you
I can feel your souls been waiting to let all my spirits through
So many faces on my spin
Words I write, remembering
All these legends that we speak
Stories told, draw minds in deep
Who can face the blackest cloud,
When lightening strikes on solid ground
Who will be left, to see the mist
Of afterlife, and happiness
Up my sleeve, there's so many things
Who knows what this killer brings?
Hypnotized, inside your mind
But still you can't see me[Chorus]
Here I go again, another check
Nobody knows what the fuck I'm after
Now you see me now you can't, disappear
Why you think ABK is so weird?
But fuck that, I got warrior skills!
I can vanish like that, *snap* for real!
Swoosh Gone! Like a dollar bill.
I'll have you're ass shiverin' with chills[Break:]
I'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight
I'll these visions, I keep havin', want to take my breath away
Non-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing
Up my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying[Chorus][Break:]
I'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight
(CAN'T GET MY HEAD STRAIGHT)
I'll these visions I keep havin', want to take my breath away
(TAKE MY BREATH AWAY)
Non-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing
(THIS WORLD KEEPS CHANGING)
Up my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying
(Keep you from decaying...)


[Talking][Anybody Killa:]
Sometimes it feels like we've been driving all night
Hungry as a stray dog, with no food in sight
Had a bomb ass show, now it's on to the next
Full tank of gas, with a bag of stress
Hoping that the next city's got that good
So that I can get my nerves straight
And make my brain shake
It's been hours, but it seems like days
Bored as a muthafucka, wide awake[Chorus:]
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go[Break: x2]
I can't take this, are we there yet?
Put the pedal to the metal, and let's ride!
We on these crazy highways, smoke away the night before
Conversating about when we come back, it's got to be just as dope
Oh the party in the parking lots, on the streets up by the beaches
It takes so much time to get there, I always have the urge to speak[Chorus]
Boogie nights, doing it right
Up till the sun comes up so who's driving?
All I know is that you better pay attention
There might be something, you're missing
So keep your eyes wide open
And look out for something weird[talking]


[Break: x2]
I don't know, I don't know
What this world is coming to
All this rage, all this rage
All this rage, all this rage[Anybody Killa:]
Let me set the world straight
Fuck the hate, man you actin' fake
Walkin around like you somebody
Let me catch you in my path
You little mark, why you flinchin'?
Detroit Streets means take precaution
You and your ? means you stuffed in a coffin
All this rage means I'm fed up
Now I'm back to my old ways cause I had enough[Lavel:]
To the people on the streets with the murder mentality
Slippin' in the alley, gettin' stuck
Why the fuck must I put up with this?
I would put up a fist but muthafuckas are trippin',
Bookin' shots like a coward that graduated from power
Education aint shit, gotcha workin' by the hour
Society got you sweatin', I suggest you take a shower
Need to pay attention, even Bin Laden gots some power[Chorus:]
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)[Anybody Killa:]
Explosions, self destructions, this world is going under
All this murder that we do, should be used in self-defense (tell 'em again)
Explosions, self destructions, this world is going under
All this murder that we do, should be used in self-defense
Scream for help and hope somebody listens,
Everybody's worried cause they loved ones is missin',
Could you tell me why does everybody have a bomb? Explosions...
Could you tell me whats the cause of this? cause of this...
Could you tell me does everybody have a bomb? Explosions...[Chorus][Shaggy 2 Dope:]
"See Right Now, What This Shit, Right The Fuck Here, Is About
Its About The Juggalo, Motherfucker!
Understand, We All Family In This Bitch
And If You Aint Family Then Fuck You!
Im Sayin', Because We All In This Bitch Together Motherfucker!
In All This Shit..."

As my fools keep rollin'
I'mma keep strollin'
Shraight to your neighborhood
Sippin' on my 40's
Screamin “Oh, lordy”
Times in my life I could
1 mile, 2 mile, 3 mile, 4
Smokin' blunts in the window
Bangin' with some hoes
Man, ya'll can't know
Ain't no room for your folks
I'm yo Ghetto Neighbor
Representing for sure
When I'm rollin' with Killa
I grip the RV
There's a nation around the world
I'm back to the D
As I slip into character
Ain't no need to front
All alone in the closet
Man, smokin' a blunt
We are the Road Fools
This is how we roll
Fridgerator full of beer
And fat sacks to smoke
Going place to place
I mean state to state
Barbeque's in the parking lot
Fix me a plate[Chorus:]
(This is)
This is all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all for you
All for you
(This is all)
This all for you

Doin', doin',

6 in the morning
Tour bus truck stopped
Pushin' eggs, some showers,
Some lizards in the locks
Head, hell yeah
The fuck you talkin' about
Road fools heading out
No doubt
My name is shittalka
I love to talk shit
This is all for you
Ain't no need to get pissed
All the poor to the people that's feelin' my groove

Because we all stand together with pride

[Laughing][Chorus: x4]
I'm so muddy,
Your so muddy,
We're so muddy,
Let's get muddy
I swing a hatchet like a warrior,
Told you all the dirty history my life obserrved
Show'd you how to keep it rollin while you actin a fool and now you wanna get all muddy cause you underground too
Don't be blinded by those mainstream raps
Eagle eyeing all your dollars but won't give you a dap I've seen them come I've seen them go
People get so emotional
Especially when you don't let them know
You see the love they show
All I know is that I pay mad dues
So respect what you getting
Cause I do it for you
And if you feeling how I'm feeling
Then I'm doing it right
So let's get muddy underground for the rest of our life's'[Chorus x6]
There is no history known not to have a trace of dirt on it
From history books, to scriptures, to missing literature
Inner self or outer selves we're all dusty in some way, shape or form
It's like a survival kit we rub on to keep unnoticed
Some spread it on thin while others pack it on like it's the fountain of youth


This is how it’s bout to go down, believe it or not, I’m still here
All you haters, time to shed another tear
Because I’m back in this bitch like your mom’s ex boyfriend
All up in your face with some brand new nonsense
Diss if you want to, go ahead and take a shot
Sooner or later that shit goin be squashed
I’m a killa with an attitude road ragin like a fool
Rolling with a family the size of a typhoon[Chorus x2]
We ain’t going away
We ain’t going away (nowhere)
We ain’t going away
We ain’t going away (far from reality)
Who you think you fucking with? This shit getting serious
Ain’t no time for busted lips, the shit I bust will turn you bitch
Turn your back and walk away, keep on thinking that you safe
It’s a small world after all, so I’ll just wait until that day
To pull my heat and lay you out or grab my blade and start to scalp
Either way I do not doubt the sweet revenge keeps me around
Silently right on your trail, if you live only time will tell
I’ll be there though if you ain’t, so you can see we here to stay[Chorus x2]
All my warriors get loud; make some room up in this crowd
Let everyone else around; see how killers put shit down
Pull it out and let it pop, listen to those bodies drop
Let them all lay their in shock, at least now they know we don’t play
Everybody recognize I’m not the type to tell you twice
Fuck with me, I guarantee that someone going pay the price
Show respect when in the room, I’m killing all that I see though
If you ever did me wrong, then I hope to see you soon[Chorus x4]


I be ticking like a time bomb ready to explode
And when I do ain’t no telling how far I’ma go
I got a hair trigger attitude, watch what you say
Beside I ain’t shot a stupid motherfucker all day
I’ve been waiting for the right time and this is it
Let me introduce myself, mudface bitch
Just another spirit jumping into the soul
Of a well known killa that be out of control[Chorus x2]
What are you gonna do
(another face on the totem pole)
When I get there
(another face on the totem pole)
Muddy Muddy
This is my time to shine, I’ma show you what I’m made of
Strong like a dinosaur but silly as some trippy drugs
Smacking ya’ll in the face with a laugh
Funny bone of the totem pole, do the math
Resurrected from the past on,
Learn the history of these warriors because we may not last long
The silhouettes you see are just thoughts of me
Ready to open your mind and feed it energy[Chorus x2]
My microphone is like an eagle feather very extinct
Too hot to hold so don’t even think about it
Can’t nobody do it like me cause I’m just a ghost
And I don’t need to breathe faster than the blink of an eye
Top notch speed, you can’t see me
I guess that’s why I’m so underground
Cause a native like me don’t be fucking around[Chorus x4]


Yo, I’ma a little hipper than the average hop
I’m the type of motherfucker you can’t stop
Especially those that make me mad
Cause I can be the worse enemy that you ever had
So if you knew me then, then you know me now
And for all the virgin ears, I’m so glad to bust you out
I be all in your face but hard to find
Underground living so this killer can hustle and grind[Chorus]
The life that you live, is it real or are you fakin?
Those rules you make, are they from your heart or were you persuaded ?
So I’ma grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow
So I’ma grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow, grind 2 the flow
You know, every time I spit it people get it because we connected
And every time we get together we wreck shit
I pay dues to make moves just like the next man
Soul of a warrior, come and catch me if you can
Some of ya’ll recognize real shit
While other are influenced and just take it like a bitch
So if you real with the words that you spill
There ain’t no reason you should feel anything you do is ill[Chorus]
I got some courage in the heavy hitting heart beat
I got the attitude to survive in the streets
I got the wisdom of an old school cat
With my mind set on one thing, taken it back
I got the nerve to go do whatever
Cause there really ain’t too many out here doing it better
So when you see me keep one thing in mind
That this motherfucking killer is always on his grind[Chorus x2]


[ABK]
My neighborhoods full of drama, killas and thugs
Everybody’s representing by throwing em up
With a quick hi, hello, or beat down baby
Even the cops know the blocks that it’s all time crazy
It’s alright cause it’s home sweet hood
Even though half of us is up to no good
You gotta love it when you born and raised
In place full of problems that you gotta face
I’m a native in the city of these Detroit streets
With a warrior mentality that won’t at ease
Tomahawk in one hand, blunt in the other
So I can just get high and swing at motherfuckers
That’s how it is, I protect my shit
On my front porch serving up free fat lips
So come and see me if you down to hang
But when you visit in the mix you can’t be acting strange[Chorus x4]
My neighborhood ain’t what it’s all crack up to be
So much drama[Boondox]
H-double o-d-c-o-v in the double 7-0 is where you finding me
With that front porch living got that lawn chair high
But don’t mistake this lifestyle for a reason to try
Cause it’s a reason to die, we straight country folk bangin
Them dirt road junkies know them country folk slangin
Got that hard, that soft, that prescription for your mentals
My neighborhood homies got them backwoods credentials
Two 4 door chevies, one’s on blocks, the other pumped out
Bad ass kids leaving grown folk’s punked out
Trailer park cooking serving up that ass
City folk’s cars swerving when them hoes walk past
Because them cornbread booties got em hypnotized
Spending college tuitions just to grip them thighs
My neighborhood to some might seem worlds away
But this is where I stay, Red clay, G-A[Chorus x4][Female]
My neighborhood[ABK]
Is on lock cause we like it that way[Female]
My neighborhood[ABK]
Is a place where the gangsta’s play[Female]
My neighborhood[ABK]
Can see right through you if you don’t belong[Female]
My neighborhood[ABK]
Can defeat all the weak and build up the strong[Female]
My neighborhood[Boondox]
Is on some shit like you ain’t never seen[Female]
My neighborhood[Boondox]
Red dirt roads full of thugs and fiends[Female]
My neighborhood[Boondox]
Country fucking mouths ain’t never heard of no blocks[Female]
My neighborhood[Boondox]
Is so far out, don’t bother calling no cop[Chorus x4]


Why these kids always smelling like a blunt
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
Two mismatched socks and hair fucked up, why
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
Never fed, always saying that they hungry
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
Now I guess I know what happened to that money
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin drugs
This situation I can’t take, now I’m angry
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
I can’t believe she would do this to the family
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs[Chorus x2]
Dear mom, how you doin (how you doin)
(I’m just writing) I’m just writing to see if you alright
Always mad, taking it out on us
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
Turning into a person no one can trust
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
It ain’t our fault that she acts this way, it’s just
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs
And if she don’t get help, then I swear will run away because
Mommy’s doin’ drugs, mommy’s doin’ drugs[Chorus x2]
It’s been about six weeks and moms seems straight
Hopefully it’s the last time she’ll have to rehabilitate
Actually it will be, for us that is cause
I’m a court date away from being granted the kids
All I know that it’s time to make a change
Erase all the memories and wipe away the pain
Embrace my kids and give em nothing but love
And try to help them forget that they mom is on drugs[Chorus x2]
Hey mom what’s up, you doing aright, we just came here to see if you alright, you know
They taking care of you up there, don’t worry about it, we got everything takin care of at home
You just get your rest, alright


What do u want from me?
Be the question, don’t you think that I gave you enough?
What about the time I took you out and just bought you all types of crazy stuff
This world ain’t nothing different, I ask it everyday
What the fuck do I gotta do, so everyone can see it my way?
If I could I would be a millionaire and help out the poor cause it’s good to share
And keep away from the ones that front, always taking what you giving cause they steadily want
So what more could you want from me, would it make you happy to watch me bleed
Or are you sticking around to just see if a killa like me is able to achieve
Was sup[Chorus]
Don’t be standing around looking like a dog on a leash
What do u want from me?
Don’t be acting like we friends, and you won’t be deceased
What do u want from me?
Don’t be acting like you know everything I’m about
What do u want from me?
What you want, is what you goin get without a doubt
What do u want from me?
What do you want from me?
I’m just askin, cause you look like you need some help
And the only thing left that I got to give are these rhymes I use myself when I’m angry
I just get so confused, think to myself what do I got to lose
There nothing more for me here to prove, so from here on out I’mma act a fool
What do you want from me? I might as well ask, cause I’m kinda in a giving mood
I got free advice for the ones that hate, this motherfucking nuts for you (bitch)
I’mma walk with my head held high through these trails of tears cause I have nothing to fear, ya’ll
I’m Detroit’s first native representing, 87 it was written memorized ready for spitting dawg[Chorus]
I’m so proud to die and I’m proud to live
And I’m going to scream it to the world til my lungs give in
If there anything I got that you think you deserve
Then next time contest my nerves
Or it’s all bad
Crazy, psycho, not right in the dome
Leave me alone
So fed up and don’t know what to do
So now it’s time to ask from you
Help me
I know you think I’m crazy
I do it for you, I do it for you
Even though it true I’m crazy
You crazy too, you crazy too[Chorus x2]


[Chorus x2]
This is my rain dance
(So let it rain)
This is my rain dance
(I’mma let it rain)
This is my rain dance
Sorry if I rained on your parade
As the world turns and the wind blows
I can make it rain with a dance, yo
Watch the earth shift like some loose hips
I’m calling bluffs from haters with them thunder lips
Let me get a second, watch this killa wreck it
On top, at times hated but well respected
I can make it rain on your parade
Anytime you want it I can make it go for days
Have you inside looking out at me
As I’m dancing in the streets
Making it pour with the heat
Let the rain fall straight from the sun
May it wash away the pain that so hard to overcome
Don’t waste your time dripping til you get dropped
If there’s anger in your heart, kill it so it never stops
Quit living life over a safety net
Ain’t no reason to be worried,
Come on out and get wet, the waters cold[Chorus x2]
In the night, getting light, when it strikes
Whoever said that it never hits twice
Grab your umbrellas because I’m giving hail
Who’s sporting floods I heard the rain coming as well
It’s about to get crazy muddy black piles with a face look strangely
Cold chills on your neck when the wind blows
Every place I stomp on this earth it just explodes
Dancing in the puddle like a kid I can see the clouds coming in
Shake the underground like a tornado at a full peak
Ain’t a Doppler in the world seeing what I bring
Let it rain on your face so your minds refreshed
Let it flow down your throat so you rhyme the best
Some say I bring the fountain of youth when it rains
While other sing a song to try and make it go away[Chorus x2]
I would let it rain until we all clean
Wash away the dirty history this world brings
Stay shinin even though I’m muddy
Always starin in the face of people lookin at me funny
Feel the cold air, don’t be so scared,
Just know one day that they’ll get theirs
Only a few understand what there is to gain
When you underneath the black sky dancing in the rain[Chorus (til end)]
Rain, rain, go away
Please come back another day [x2]


I just don’t understand how everyone in this world, all of a sudden, got so hard
Could it be me or just does it seem like certain people try and take it too far
I don’t know but when the time comes, motherfuckers better show respect
And if they don’t then you best believe, this warrior going to shave some heads with a dull hatchet
Ain’t no fooling around, I’ll beat the shit out of your bitch and dump shots in your moms house
I got the urge to ball up my fist and start swingin, so since I’m in a bad mood, bring it[Chorus]
What’s with the attitude?
What’s with it, what’s with it
What’s with the attitude?
Everybody’s entitled to have one
What’s with the attitude?
What’s with it, what’s with it
What’s with your attitude?
Everybody’s entitled to have one
I’m aggravated, feeling depressed, it’s like my hearts beating too damn fast
People in my face makin it muddy from the dirt that they talk and I need to clean it off
Sometimes I need to get away to another place away from all the hate
So I can sit back and relax and try to clear my head
Instead of staying in the hood and leaving bodies for dead
I’m so damn emotional, and I think that it’s time for me to take control
Instead of fast pace I’m gonna put it in slow mo,
So you will understand when I say don’t test me ho[Chorus]
Lots of people say I’m a kind hearted guy
I am but some of ya’ll should be terrified
Why, guess it all boils down to trust
Before a motherfucker really starts to self destruct
Attitudes, everyone’s entitled, but some of ya’ll take it to a level that’s vital
Mood swings, Jekyll and Hyde, aggravated individuals upset with life
Who wants try to calm me down when I’m in a state of mind that wants to let off rounds
Guess I’m tired of just playing it cool, so every now and then I get an attitude[Chorus (til end)]


Hey man you alright?
No
I seen how your ol girl was coming down on you
Yeah
What happened? Your pops found out you lost that job and shit
mmm-hmmm
Well don’t worry homey, man parent be like that sometimes, it’s like they mad at you because they get old. Just don’t go all crazy on me, talking about you going to kill yourself again, alright
Yes, in my mind I want to do it but when I pursue it I can’t seem to go through it
So I’m going to write a song just so you can feel everything I feel when I’m in the mood to kill myself
I can’t control it, these thoughts of suicide, I’m always dealing with
And I know I’m not alone when it comes to this, cause everyday it’s like the whole world pissed
So fuck your attitude and keep your bad mood cause I got one too
And I don’t give a shit who you rolling with bring your whole damn crew
We’ll call it suicide when you messin with a killa someone’s bound to die
And it won’t be me cause only one’s claimin my life is g-o-d[Chorus x2]
You ever thought of suicide, you ever thought of suicide, you ever thought of suicide
Glad you didn’t do it, if you did you wouldn’t be here now
Are you easily influenced,
Does your parents always say that your friends are the reason that you ruint
Do you have hate for your boss, to where you wanna catch him alone and pop one off
Or is it mental health, where the only problem that you have is with yourself
Can someone please explain why it feels so good to cause so much pain
With all these thoughts we have, yep it’s easy to say to just relax
But when you that fed up, only thing in your mind is how deep to cut
Because you hate your life and you really don’t care
And things would be better if you just weren’t here
So now you ready to go end it all,
Instead of thinking of the ones you won’t see tomorrow[Chorus x2][Strict 9]
It’s nothing nice, got the thoughts steadily running through my head
I close my eyes and try to picture if I’m better off dead
It sucks to me, the one and only as I sit here by my lonely
Separated from the world cause the world is so phony
Hear my cries, tell me why when you do it tell them lies
You wear a disguise I can see it in your motherfuckin eyes
It’s suicide, last ride if you wanna get inside
Shotgun it’s your boy and I’m ready to die[ABK]
Do people that commit suicide go to heaven?
I’m sure everyone has their own theories
But I’m a firm believer that if you take you own life
Your soul is trapped[Chorus x2]


All this time I spend just writing down
These thoughts that build in my head
I try to get away but they keep chasing me down
They tell me set them free
So this is how I release
By giving everything to you
So you can witness what’s in me[Chorus x2]
All I am is who you see (who you see)
All I give is what you really need (what you believe)
I’m just me, I’m just me
I’m just me, I’m just me
Yeahhhhhh
I just don’t understand why these feeling take control over me
Is it just because I’m weak or is my mind all that they need
Cause when I close my eyes is when they usually try to speak
And when I awake I just grab my pen because that’s how I spread my wings[Chorus x2]
Is your eyes wide open, do you feel like you can’t keep copin
Do you believe in what you see
All these words that have been spoken keep some alive
And always searchin because they believe in what they see[Chorus x4]


Never come outside but you know that they want to (x5)
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Never come outside but you know that they want to
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Never come outside but you know that they want to
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Never come outside but you know that they want to
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Just moved onto a new street and the motherfuckers sweet
Liquor store right on the corner which is good because I drink
Had to move because my old crib was looking all hit
Aluminum falling off the sides like a snake does his skin
Anyway where I’m at now is so much better
Except for the kids man I swear they need to get they shit together
Staring at me out the window all crazy
Never met me but they lookin like they hate me
What did the parents do to make these children so damn rude
Stuff them in the closet, and beat they ass with a shoe
They need to let em outside, but it’s like they never do
So now these kids stare out the window and give me the attitude[Chorus x2]
Let em outside [x4]
Hey let those children play
I don’t know whether I should leave or stay
Because if I take on too much I might go insane
Little bad asses, half my age
Locked in they crib like a cage
Looking out through the shades
It’s like my whole blocks been hypnotized
And now they trying to get to me with this glare from they eyes
Just beamin at this killa with their infrared
Like I’m the main reason they on house arrest
I thought kids was supposed to have fun
Instead of being all pale from never seeing the sun
If it was me, I’d have to break free
Cause life too short not to be able to breathe[Chorus x2][Chorus 2 - x2]
Why don’t they come out
Let them out
Why don’t they come out
Let them out
Why they look so lonely[Chorus x2][Chorus and Chorus 2 - x2]
Why they look so lonely? [x2]


Everybody running acting like they don’t know where they going [x6]
As I walk through the trails of life I get so disturbed
So little time with so much to learn
All these faces askin for me to help
But I barely getting through this myself
That why I’m here writing
Poor man’s therapy put your pain to words
Make it all fit together just to share it with the world
That’s why some people just don’t understand
Cause my rhymes are like a puzzle that they mind can’t comprehend
But that’s the path they chose, the lonely road,
Where the street signs read your now out of control
Not me though, I’m in it for the long haul
So I’ma fuckin make it, even if I have to crawl
I’m not the type that wants to learn from mistakes
So every chance I get I think of moves to make
I’m underestimated but I’m still here
Cause the name of the trail I’m on is have no fear[Chorus x2]
(As I walk through)
Which way do I go, which way do I go, which way do I go, which way do I go, follow me
(These trails of tears)
Are you lost? Do you know which way to go?
The path your on, is it fast or is it slow?
Is it everything that you always dreamed?
Or is it just little more than what it seems?
Are you headed on the one that fits?
Or do you wish you could go back and switch it up right quick?
Now I mean right is in the right path
But quick is in a hurry for them slow motherfuckers who always act like they don’t hear me
This is my last attempt for your attention, any more wasted time will just be a failed mission
If you ain’t down, why even mention my name
Tryin to hate on me cause of your own self shame
Some only do it cause they wish they was me
That’s why the path that they lead is called whack mc’s
As my true warrior keep shit real, walking the concrete trails ready to kill at will
I’m with’cha[Chorus x2]
It’s time to take you on a whole new journey
But we got to stick together cause it might get lonely
We headed through the muddy swamps, for real
And this experience might change how you feel
Whether it’s good, bad, happy, or sad
Just as long as you follow you gonna find your path
And where it ends, it’s all up to you
Just as long as you try you’re best to make it through
Let’s go[Chorus x2]


[Shaggy 2 Dope]
See most motherfuckers is scared to kill a motherfucker
It takes three of us working on this track that ain’t scared of shit
Killa give it to em motherfucker[ABK]
You ain’t no killa bitch, let me show you how it’s done
Cut you with a slice across the neck and when they scream rip out the tongue
I really don’t give a shit cover you up with the blood of a pig
Then drop you off in the woods at night, for the animals to hunt while you sit
You ain’t no killa, we beneath the streets, that’s what we do
Running with a hatchet, screaming motherfuckers, swingin right at you
This for my real killas the quiet midnight creepers
The ones you see yellin’ over, give your whole damn crew the jeepers
(I ain’t going near that painted up freak)[Chorus x3]
You ain’t no killa
Let us show you a killa
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it’s done
Hey J, this motherfucker thinks he a killa[Violent J]
You ain’t no killa, being grounded ain’t no hard time
You dove in(?) with no shine, you cannot borrow mine
You makin stories up, you talkin helli crimes
But your ass all bitch, no panties lines
You need an arrow bucked between your eyebrows
You playin Russian roulette and loading live rhymes
You ain’t a killa, couldn’t kill a mosquito
Talk enough shit to fill the streets of Toledo
You ain’t no killa
(You all ready, I got the bb’s)[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it’s done
Shaggy the clown show em how us real killas put it down[Shaggy 2 Dope]
With these bare hands I can put you in a coma
That’s what I told you right before I choked ya
Don’t wanna say that I told you so but I told ya
You talk that shit like you hard you about as hard as a scrotum
I don’t get it, why you lyin won’t admit it baby
Softer than a baby hoot (?) that someone granulated
You ain’t a killa you about as hard as creamy vanilla
I grab my hatchet and use you back for target practice for realla
You ain’t a killa
(Stick em up, motherfucker,) smack Bitch (Ahhh) you trying to rob me (sorry)[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it’s done[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it’s done[Chorus x3]
We going to show you, we going to show you, we going to show you how it’s done


I’m as crazy as I wanna be, ain’t no stopping me
Buck wild, tearing up the streets in the D
Just a native with some war paint actin a fool
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too
Smoking weed like it’s free and the first to kill a 40
Only one to shoot a pistol in the middle of a party
Hanging on the block without a clue what to do
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too
I’m not sayin we no good just a little abnormal
Underground is where we lay, the main stream is too formal
I’m learning things they don’t teach in the school
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too[Chorus x2]
If you do what I do (Yea)
And I do what you do (Yea)
Wouldn’t that kinda make us all the same (Yea)
Wait for the right time, patient like a snake
Slither to your enemy then show his ass some hate
This is just something that I like to do
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too
Always down with a BBQ, drinkin brew with the crew
Up til the sun come, way past curfew
Talking about things that I wanna pursue
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too
Never sit and argue, squash it with my tennis shoe
Kung-fu a motherfuckas head into fondue
That’s how it is, and I’ll never improve
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too[Chorus x2]
I prefer Yager bombs instead of Absolute
But I’d rather have a blunt packed with purple or blue
Red skin with the hatchet running looking confused
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too
Ever since I was a youth in pursuit to amuse
Crassin(?) Avenue I cruise to promote my new
I did everything I could to make my name break through
And some of ya’ll be doing the same things too
I was showing up late cause I had to finish smoking
You know how the weed have you in slow motion
Thank god I’m not alone because it wouldn’t be cool
I’m so glad ya’ll be doing the same things too
(What time, um, I thought this was tony from the block
Tonys’ on after this rap)[Chorus x2]
You do (yeah)

Wouldn’t that kinda make us all the same? (yeah) (x2)

Or is ti because my flow
Make a real muh fucca wanna lose control
People hate me because they racist
Actin like they neva seen a native goin places
Muddy face and all
Creepin up to attack and take out the frauds
If you are here I suggest you bounce
Unless you wanna see a tommy hawk split your mouth
In other words
Put that racist in his place
Do what you gotta
No matta what it takes[Chorus]
Get stopped by the cops
Cuz I represent
Like it's my fault
Your thoughts don't mean shit
So they pull the race card, gang-related
Group in this in a hoopty faded
Who do they think they are
Hatin on me cuz I'm raisin the cause
My life, my mind, my choices
Fucc what they think
I ignore hatin voices
Try to tell us how to dress
And how to act
And how to live
Fucc that
Well they can keep they balls
You put your hands up
What what! ?
You with the sticcer int he window
It's a fuccin sticcer
What are you doin with that in your window
It's a fuccin sticker
Put your hand up and get down on the ground
THIS IS SOME BULL SHIT[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm on top
Wanted dead or alive by the world
Cuz I'm bringing somethin hot
I'm a killa that you can't stop
Never once will you see tied down on the tracks in a knot
I get chased cuz I hate
Now I'm ready to fight
If anybody wanna make it
Bring the move right on
And if your fuccin luccy
At your funeral they will play this song
He lived life for love and good
Now he's dead and gone
It's his tim eor this world hatin
Doin others wrong
How come people build up courage
To hate on someone else
That's why I keep it underground
Stay away from all the stress[Chorus]


It's time to be real y'all
It's time to be real y'all
I said it's time to be real y'all
First breathe
Started off a bad ass
East side roamin
Out late gettin cash
Killas don't talk
So I can't say shit
So read between the lines
And just paint your own pic
Hustlin baby
On the grind
I was brought up right
But stayed outta line
Guess you can say when you lose
You're lost
But wit my parents passin on
I had to be boss[Chorus:]
I'ma keep it real
I'ma keep it real
It's all I've ever known
I'ma keep it real
I'ma keep it real
Couldn't nobody give me rules
Every now and then a jail cell
But what's that prove
I was still bein hard headed
Claimin the streets
(We have a red skinded male here disturbin the streets)
Problems problems, everybody's got em
Jack and sticc and cut and shoot and rob and
I was addicted to all
Had to change and find a better way
To be well off[Chorus]
Nowadays I got a strong mind
I see it all
No need for safety nets
Cuz I will never fall
Keep it floatin like a ghost at night
And put fear in those who's eyes just ain't right
I got angels watchin over
I can feel em when I'm speakin
Like they're on my shoulder
And I admit that it sure feels good
To finally get a chance to be understood
Hard times was broke payin dues
Made a lot of friends and I met a lot of fools
That's why I'm here on the mic today
Cuz I'ma be real and tell you what I need to say[Chorus]

This time I'm comin swingin
With my hatchet high
I'm about to let it loose
Cause it's do or die
Go ahead and tell somebody
Spread the word to the streets
ABK done lost his mind
Now he's disturbed his peace
Hey I don't give a shit
And you could let it be know
And Imma let it be shown
Mother fucker I'm grown
Imma swing if I want to
And you can't stop me
It's too hard to do if ya weak and sloppy
Put yo fist up
Swing em til somebody cries
Supersize a hater up with a order of knuckle fries
Let em see just how we doin
And what it's like to have somebody comin after you
Watch out![Chorus x4]
Go tell everybody ya know
That everybody ya know
Tell everybody ya know
This time I'm comin swingin[Verse 2]
So I'm a psycho
I could deal wit it
Ain't no thang
It's ok I agree I love bringin the pain
And I'm not the only who loves they hatchet
Swinging it with perfection
From plenty of practice
I'm just a native
That's out for kill
It's time to battle
So understand I'm comin for real
I don't think when it happens
It just comes to me
And if I can't walk away
I stand so they can see[Talking]
When you step into the ring, ready to do yo thang
Come swingin, What!, Come swingin
If they love to talk cause a fights what they want
Come swingin, What!, Come swingin[Chorus]
The hatchet warrior,
yet another psychopathic, known to kill anyone in his,[Verse 3]
Sharp like an axe blade
Swift on my feet
Born to come hard
With my animal instincts
Nightcrawlin to watch yo health
I'm the sound that you hear when you by yourself
Like a killa on the streets
I be that's me
Comin hotter than the sun cause I'm bringin the heat
So if you Rollin wit me come on
It's time to get the show on
And bring it to these mother fuckers
Actin like they so grown
Break em down like a bag of some boot weed
And tell them you ain't someone to defeat
Put it out there so that it's known
That the hatchet better come swingin or go home[Chorus x8]


If I had the one last chance to do things over in my life
One last chance to say things to people before they left or past on,
The opportunity to see the ones close to me every day,
Just to say: hey,
If I had that one last chance, then, then,
I'd be all right.[Chorus:]
If I had one last chance to say: hey, hey
I would be all right,
If I had one last chance to say: hey, hey
I would be alright.
If I had just one last chance to tell you how I feel
For leaving here eternally.
I would tell you what you meant to me
And what's been going on.
If I had just one last chance to say
What's on my mind,
Cause ever since you had to leave,
There's some people who ain't been the same,
Because it takes time.
If I had just one last chance to really say goodbye,
Right before you went away.
I think it'd really makes a difference to me,
And I'd be all right.
If I had just one last chance to apologize,
For everything I put you through.
I would probably finally rest and peace
Instead of sleepless nights.[Chorus x2]
If I had just one last chance to hear you speak to me,
What would you say? about the way that I carry on, in my life.
If I had just one last chance to try and make it right,
What advice would you give, that'd make me wanna just calm me down,
And re-think things twice. (If I just had one chance)
If I had one last chance, last chance, last chance, (that would be all that I need)
If I had one last chance, just to tell you, goodbye
If I had one last chance, last chance, last chance, (that would be all that I need)
If I had one last chance... Why'd you have to go!?[Chorus x2]
If I had one last chance, I would not keep you long,
The bond that we had is strong enough to carry on,
Inside the songs we sing, the memory of you will bring
Us closer to everything that's keeping us all a team.
If I had one last chance just say goodbye,
I'd tell you that I'd miss you until the day I die.
If I could see your face in front of me once again,
The room would brighten up and the world would see me grin.[Chorus x6]

My hearts beating rapidly and I'm losing my breathe
All the excitement from the stage has got me drippin' with sweat
I'm kinda nervous but I know soon it'll all go away
Because I have an angel watching over me keepin' me safe
Any journey that I travel I know that I'm a survive
Cause I'm protected by the spirit that was put here to guide
Even though I'm used to it it still gets to me
But there's still no other place that I'd rather be
I'm just nervous [x2]
I gotta do it
Shake the nerves off and pursue it
Time waits for no man so you can't renew it
When you build enough confidence to try it again
A second chance is the shit
If it's there my friend get it done the first time
Ease your mind
You get a lot more respect if your willing to shine
And don't let nobody bring you down
Cause you gave it a shot
Cause it's the practice that makes you perfect
Believe me or not
Ya just nervous [x2]
My stomachs turning
I'm kinda weak in the knees
It's so hard to just be patient when your ready like me
To try and concur every obstacle that's put in your face
And if your willing to take it on with style and grace
I'm kinda nervous (really nervous)
But I will get by
And you can bet your life
If I keep on tryin'
Only surviving
And just build my shine one day at a time
And stop being nervous
(Stop being nervous)


I'm on my way,
And I'm movin' top speed.
Ain't no lookin' back,
so don't even wave to me.
I'm goin' for a time to chase what I believe.
In other words I'm following my dreams.
So many set they mind to do the same,
Even if it seems a little strange.
(They still do it)
Take my advice, that there's more in life to gain,
If you just willin' to fight through the pain.
(and keep kickin'!)[Chorus]
Can't nobody change me,
Or what I believe.
So I'm here to make it and 
need to go out and achieve.
Outdone by no one,
New life's test run.
Thought my time was up,
But the journey had just begun.
Can't nobody change me,
Or what I believe.
So I'm here to make it and 
need to go out and achieve.
Outdone by God's Son,
New life's test run.
Thought my time was up,
But the journey had just begun.
This life we live,
the struggles we face.
the path we're on,
The moves we make.
At any time can all be replaced,
Like a memory in your head just being erased.
So I'll move on,
just to keep the lead.
And make sure that
nobody gets in front of me.
(look out)
It's like I can't stop now,
The power that I feel
when I'm hearin' the crowd.
(Juggalo!) 
It's just so addicting,
(FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
the love that you get,
with no sight of friction.
(FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
will keep you moving,
til you're all worn out.
That's the type of feelin' 
that I'm talkin' about![Chorus]
I got the secret and it changed my mentality,
Now I'm pushing all my energy into the galaxy.
Like a Jager Bomb, gives you personality,
I'm on my way, so don't try to come after me.
(get out my way!)
Advertise every time they criticize,
Instead of looking deep into what's real in our eyes.
So, realize...
Some look at us as a joke,
and get upset 'cause they got choked,
when they tried to provoke.[Chorus x2]


I rebuke you in the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost.
What up fam? I'm here on a more personal level. I say we take this peace pipe, fire up the end and let's roll out. 
Elevate your soul with a piece of the earth. 
Get rid of all the stress inside before you get someone hurt.
Take a hit of the weed, if you think that you can. Now hold it in homie, hold it, hold it... Damn. I love the sound of virgin lungs right before they bust. So if you want to come and smoke, peace pipe with. Let me take you to a level where you ain't been yet. Come and step in to circle and let's all get wrecked.
Until we meet again, I'll guess see you. Take it easy. So long homie. Nice smokin' with you... keep it peaceful. My journey ain't over yet ya'll someone in this bitch about to get me High.
One time open your mind body and soul and let yourself be possessed by the indo smoke. Write down your problems, roll them up and let's burn them away. Ain't no reason to be chillin' all sad and gray. Acting like a lost pup, teary eyed and stuff. Look every time I pass the blunt you fucked the rotation up. Let's keep it floating playa' smoke smoke gimmeh my dope. I'll see you in my next journey when I re-up bro.
Until we meet again, I'll guess see you. Take it easy. So long homie. Nice smokin' with you... keep it peaceful. I don't know what strand this is but this shit has got my ass Stoned.
Until we meet again, I guess I'll see you. Take it easy. So long homie. Nice smokin' with you... keep it peaceful. Keep it peaceful.
You know I met alot of cool ass people livin' life this way. Laid back, while getting stoned every damn day. Understand in one another while we sparking this bowl. Conversating through whole night, let the time just... go.


Don't fucking piss me off.
I said don't fuckin' piss me off.
Choke your fucking head.
I hurt myself to make the pain disappear.
and then I fear that if people see my scars they will call me weird. 
I'm out of control with it, I know I need help plus I'm tired of these cards that my life was dealt. And see that I am not the only one who cuts every time I think the world sucks. Is it a problem I have some kind of complication cause my only aggravation is my own dedication. I got a big heart that looks out for most even if I'm feeling lost paint it forward is how I roll. and I know that there's a lot more to gain even if we have a little happy pain. (Dick) So cut with me. I'm feeling born again every time my heart bleeds from the tip of my pen. Like I'm inhaling fresh oxygen instead of always being on the defensive end.
Bang yo head (Up against a wall, wish you were dead)
Slit yo wrist (Then hide the cuts so no one knows what you did)
I'm so pissed (as if the only way that I could forget)
Is to self inflect (a little pain to make me happy again) 
Bang yo head.
Yeah, I've been down on my mothafuckin' luck, I've lost jobs I've wanted to bang my head against a wall. Slit my wrists and bleed all over your brand new white tee shirt. Bitch WHAT!
Let the pain make you happy like a stress reliever. When the world got you feeling like a underachiever. In my 80's were like so depressive and if you know me well then you know I'm aggressive. I got a rap sheet for being a deadbeat. I guess I'm incomplete so my body i miss treat. It's like I really never did belong. So I made a theme song, come and sing along. If people hate me, I'm no good. I always say I'm miss understood. I been this way since my childhood and I've dealt it my way the best I could. I'm confident so I must attempt not to bang my head over no nonsense and if I do I face the consequence of finding out the hard way of having common sense.
Bang yo head (Up against a wall, wish you were dead)
Slit yo wrist (Then hide the cuts so no one knows what you did)
I'm so pissed (as if the only way that I could forget)
Is to self inflect (a little pain to make me happy again) 
Bang yo head.
Bang yo head ya'll. 
Let it hurt!
And if you wanna get really deep let the blood spill
Ill be mad than a mothafucka
I'm about to take the pain out on myself so I can be... Happy again.


I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2]
I reposition in a,
Fatal position then ill,
Choke him out until he's
Out of commission then I'll,
Drive around looking where I can ditch him a
Dark road out of town with no sign of a witness (woo!)
I don't care about a punk ass shrink, all he wants is the medicate the way I think, (here take this)
And I can do that shit on my own 'cause I don't need no help from some unknown
Head therapist telling me how it is (Hell naw)
He tryna get me to tell him my bizz (Hell naw)
I'm getting pissed I don't need this fool,
Thinking that I'm gonna break down and trust you?
I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2]
Evaluation huh?
I'm no longer a patient,
I'm in the back seat of your car just waiting
'Cause I don't take what people say about me kindly
So when I see you then I'll put it all behind me,
Not in a good way 'cause I keep a long grudge,
You kept pushing but I would not budge,
I be the type that you don't wanna fight,
I'm street with it you might not come home that night
So, say what you will but I don't need no pill to turn me into a zombie with no thrill (no thrill)
Naw, I wanna be accidental and not some test 'bout me 'cause you think that I'm mental
I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2]
How long have I've been mentally insane?
And do I think I might need to be restrained?
Before I cause myself or someone else pain,
With my anger so bad that I can't be tamed
How long have I've been mentally insane? (HELP) [x4]
And do I think I might need to be restrained? (HELP) [x4]
Before I cause myself or someone else pain, (HELP) [x4]
With my anger so bad that I can't be tamed (HELP) [x4]
I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2] (Help)
My mental evaluation says I need help
(Men [x3] Mentally Insane...)
(I can't be tamed)
My mental evaluation says I need help


Ain't a doctor in the world gotta cure for this,
mind state medicated I'm a psycho, bitch.
All day I'm paranoid and I'm bout to explode,
because the ghost of my ex still want's control. 
(so)
She comes to visit just to tell me that she's hurt,
and it's my fault, that I'm the the reason that she's in the dirt
(it's because of you) 
What a weight to carry on my back,
when it was you who didn't really know how to act, bitch![Chorus]
I see the ghost of my ex-girlfriend and that bitch still hates me.
(that bitch still hates me)
She always said that I would see her again but this is way to crazy
(that bitch still hates me)
If I treated you better instead of how I did,
would you still be living but this time as a friend
instead of the ghost, of the ex bitch I used to fuck that still hates me
(that bitch still hates me)
I stay awake, with some jager in my energy drink,
contemplating in my mind how this monster fits
And how I could be to blame for her suffer and pain,
that I put this girl through when I treated her strange.
cuz you know we never really got along,
and it always seemed like I was doing her wrong
either one way or another, it was my fault...
That's why I had to let her go or at least I thought...
(but she's still with me)
Come back, saying asking if I still care,
and if I don't I should take my life or just beware...
Like she's a higher power, given me my final hour
wantin me to drop to me knees and go out like a coward
Who the fuck this bitch think I am?
telling me to look deep inside her pentagram 
I know she want's to take my soul, and it's just not fair
So, I gotta be prepared if she dare[Chorus]
Did I do it? That bitch stressed to death,
but I did get on the last nerve that she had left.
She should'a never told me that I wouldn't amount, 
cause ever standard I see I put up I start breakin it down.
This girl was always on my back tryin'a tell me what to do
Now I'm sitting in the pitch dark lookin like a fool
Now instead of hangin with homies under the deep blue sky
I'm being followed by the spirit of a past stoned love life
(cause she's still with me)
Brain-dead with her wings spread
Clothes still stained, from the blood shed  
(she's with me)
Like a shadow that ain't mine, bottom line
wish I could just give her the peace sign
And now we close the gates to hell [Chorus till end]


[Girl:]
There's old Indian Legends, that say lightning is when raven is angry.
And that's his feet tearing across the sky.
And that thunder, is when he's screaming.
You think because he's angry, or because he's sad?
I think he's mad.
I think, I think Raven's mad tonight.[ABK:]
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
I'm so angry and I'm a let the world know it, if seeing is believing then it's time for me to show it. (Watch this)
I put the lightning and ignite when I fly by, and make the earth shake when I scream into the sky.
Some look at me like I'm bringing bad intention, they see me plucking on the souls of all the unforgiven.
I got the visibility to see inside, all the deepest fears that people try to hide.
I'm watching over waiting for my next attention looking out for bodies ready to surrender, the next contender.
So when you see me come, ya better run for cover.
Cause it's time to make these motherfuckers suffer![Chorus:]
The dark sky of evil [x3]
I think raven is mad tonight. [x2]
Dark visions that ignite with no paper or color, heart stopping jaw dropping cause I do it so prefer.
I'm from another dimension looking for someone to witness.
We scream to a higher god just to relief some tension.
I got a lot of self-hate that I must rotate, before I rip through the sky I start to aggravate.
Turning all of my power into electrical shower and burn the visions of a hot flame about to devour.
I'm taking back my reputation as the owner in the sky, so when you see me flying by just look deep into my eyes.
Bringing drama to the world cause it gets what it deserves.
And if it wasn't for the raven then the earth would never turn![Chorus:]
The dark sky of evil [x3]
I think raven is mad tonight. [x2]
Let's not breathe in this open season and I'm so bad.
While I continue fighting evil in you, built up from your last.
Hear my thunder feel my pain rumble under this earth.
White-blue lightning keeps darkness shining, so I can see you when I lure.[Chorus:]
The dark sky of evil.
I think raven is mad tonight.


I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
I'm flying high on my red eye
And winding down the windows
I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
My future is a Valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime
And as the hours go flashing by
I'm winding down the windows
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die


NEED AIR FOR LIFE.....WE ALL BREATH.

Four thirty A.M, I'm awake again
Singing to the dark through open eyes
While dreaming I see only you and me
Stuck between desire and compromise
If I said I want you back I'd be a liar
There's nothing left of us to long for anymore
But inside the ashes burns an endless fire
And every night I can't help reaching out for more
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
You're leaving me scars scattered in my heart
A road map of all the places you have been
And I can't escape, can't wash this away
Love has burned your mark so deep within
If I said I want you back I'd be a liar
There's nothing left of us to long for anymore
But inside the ashes burns an endless fire
And every night I can't help reaching out for more
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep


I wait for you, my love
I ache for you, my love
Call this a liquid love
Rain down on me
You should have come over
Your love slips through my hands
These streets like sinking sand
Drowning in liquid love
Rain down on me
I call out your name
(You should have come over)
Your love is chasing through my veins
(You should have come over)
Such a foolish game
(You should have come over)
Your love's no good for me, good for me
But it makes me happy
Makes me happy
I wait for you, my love
I ache for you, my love
Call this a liquid love
Rain down on me
I call out your name
(You should have come over)
Your love is chasing through my veins
(You should have come over)
Such a foolish game
(You should have come over)
Your love's no good for me, good for me
But it makes me happy


Slipping sideways, silver stars collide
And fade away just like our love that died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide from you tonight
I've wrestled with angels all my life
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind
And if I'd fought with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Slipping sideways, silver stars collide
And fade away just like our love that died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide from you tonight
I've wrestled with angels all my life
It's always the halos and the wings that keep you blind
And if I'd fought with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
Alone tonight just like the western star, I'm sinking.
The angels curse me blind with straight and crooked thinking
And if I'd fought with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here alone tonight


To be with you is easy
I know you're good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
To for feel for you is easy oh baby
I know your good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
You're good for me my baby
So good for me my love
You're good for me my baby
So good for me oh love


Hey you

Hey you
For all I care for you [2x]
And I need

Here I come to find myself, catch the tide
Looking for a peace at the end of the line
Sometimes I can't help myself feel the tide
I'm all at sea and so unwise
I'm so afraid I'd lose your love as time goes by
But courage is a fire and a beacon so bright
The sunset builds a memory - our love signed
And all I see becomes a lie
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call the setting sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home!
I close my eyes, I know you're there, love of mine
Standing on the shore in a world I designed
The sunset fires a lonely flare into the sky
And all I see we say goodbye
Will I wash away, turning like a stone?
I need a place where I belong
Call the setting sun to throw me down the road
And take me to a place called home!
Looking for a place called home


All these words you speak to me
Are from a foreign land
You're telling me that birds don't fly
How can it be that you love her?
You don't have to raise your voice
I still don't understand
There's me and you, and you and me
So how can it be that you love her?
It was alchemy
To sing to me your freedom song
To make love where there was none
Alchemy ~ now it's all gone
And she is the golden one
So what are you saying?
We've got to dismantle it all?
Rip up the paper, smash up the walls
How can it be that you love her?
Take all of the things that we so carefully made
Take all of the life you have betrayed
How can it be that you love her?


It's raining, it's pouring
A black sky is falling
It's cold tonight
You gave me your answer
Goodbye
Now I'm all on my own tonight
And when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win
We were in heaven you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you, you'll never get over me
And when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win
We were in heaven you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky[x4:]
(I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you, you'll never get over me)


Dream on, little dreamer! This is how it all begins
Move your feet ~ feel how sweet it is
Dream on, little dreamer! Follow all your signs
You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you 
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
You know you got to go!
Keep on, little dreamer ~ keep hold of all that you are


It's the same old scene
You've been stuck at the screen for a lifetime
You keep your mind sharp and clean 
With a fix of caffeine for the nighttime
You got a page full of friends
In a world without end, DIKU?
But if push comes to shove
You can do without them if they make you
With all this poison inside
It's much too late to decide
You've got your mind made up
You've been living a lie in your white room
For all the hours that you've cried
There's a year of love they denied
So you slip through the door
And fall to the floor in your BLACK ROOM
You're a black room boy
You're feeling so weighed down
Forget the losses and burn down
Fall into city lights
Nothing else is easy
You kissed your mummy's hand
Wearing daddy's ring
When they left you
And you buried yourself in the pain
That they couldn't accept you
You're in a world of your own
Got no cellular phone -- they can't track you
But the girl at the stove
With a sketchy rapport
She will back you


For so long now 
for so long now I've been trying
It's not working
I've been trying and hoping and wishing
with every part of me
It's not working
I've been giving it out
But it's not coming back to me, baby
Kept thinking that somehow...
But I'm going to go now~
(Now I want to be FREE)
You can call out my name
and tell me about your pain
But I'm not coming back to you, baby
I'll be giving it out
But it's not going to come back to you
There's only so much
Only so much you can do
My heart is breaking
I keep on giving it out
Because I love you~
But ohhh this is not enough for me
Now I want to be free
I'll be giving it out
All the good stuff
Giving it out to someone
Who loves me


You always laugh when I cry
I'm always looking to tomorrow
As you mourn the days gone by
You always tread on my toes
But my guiding hand of love
Is helping everywhere you go
I'm always WRONG you're always RIGHT
But I can see right through the LIES
To the never changing light
Rain on me, my arms are cold
I want to get home but there's water on the road
And if I do, you will not change
I'm just a singing satellite in an orbit
that is strange
I want to laugh, I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
And stop me THINKING for a while
I'm just a fool hung on a sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am a king, a KING
A king of everything & nothing
I'm on my way to heaven
I'm always here, I'm in denial
And when there's nothing left between us
I will stay another while
You know you're free, you've got your wings
And I am just another angel
With a voice who wants to sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Almighty
I'm on my way to heaven
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on my way to HEAVEN
I want to cry, I want to steal
A little ray of perfect sunshine
From the sun above the hill
I want to laugh, I want to smile
Get your arms inside my head
And stop me THINKING for a while
I'm just a fool hung on a sting
But since you put these thorns around my head
You know I am a king, a KING
A king of everything & nothing
I'm on my way to heaven


I've had too many a good cry for you
This is my time to say goodbye to you
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned,
To see the journey through
This is not yours alone
It hurts me too
Please don't say you don't care
(I know you do)
Love is not enough for me
If it screams when you hold it
Love is not enough for me
Love is hurting if it screams
Oh if it's screaming out loud
Love is not enough
One day you will fly away from here
One day you will leave your hurts behind


Every little beat of your heart
You get a little closer to me
You've never been so happy since I've been around
I don't want to tear your world apart
But that's how it's going to be
Your head's in the sky but I'm underground
Words come slow to me
Silence easily
But the world spins 'round and 'round
A heart is breaking, the mess I'm making
Every little beat of your heart
You're painting a picture of me
You put me on a pedestal, I can't climb down
Every little beat of my own
Takes me further from you
I've run out of heaven & I'm closing down
There's an actor in this town
And he follows you around
He gets his lines right every time
But his heart is breaking
He's tired of faking


You have the sweetest heart


There was a time, there was a place
But there was fear inside
A witty line to save my face
A parachute of pride
To cross the line takes a tiny step
But will the spark cause the bridge to burn
My fear entwined with my regret
I beat a path for safe return
So here we are, we're just the same
And you will never know
My secret plan, how close we came
To share another road
And have I lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside?
Is it just me, I'd like to know
Or are we all just a little blind?
There's a thing called love that we all forget
And it's a wasted love that we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget, forget about a thing called LOVE


Only a few things will we recall
With love, with gratitude
Only a few things
On the hour in which I die
So if I cannot tell you
If the words I do not find
I want you to know
There are only a few things
That I will be carrying
In my memory when I go
Only a few things will we recall
With true happiness, with gratitude
Only a few things
I see you ~
I see you ~
You ~ you were the joy in my life
The one who loved my tired bones
The one who came to stay
So if I do not tell you
If I don't find the words
It is NOT because I don't feel it in my heart
You're the one who loved my tired bones
You're the one who took me home
You ~ you brought joy to my world
So I will tell you now
In case you don't know
That you'll be with me
When I go
Only a few things will we recall
With love, with gratitude
Only a few things
On the hour in which I die


Connected to talk
singing through a forest of ice
This slow motion moment is tumbling down
Till we're lost inside the sound
It's your worst fall
you push me through the walls
And I just can't cope
You're breaking my heart with your hope
You’re breaking my heart with your hope
You’re breaking my heart with your hope
You’re breaking my heart with your hope


Don’t they know that there’s something going on?
What they’re harming with their indecision
But who will be left standing when I’m gone?
There’ll be nothing left but a vision
It’s too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
It’s too easy to bow your head and pray
But there are some times
When you should try to find your voice
This is one voice that you must find today
Are you hoping for a miracle
As the ice caps melt away?
No use hoping for a miracle
There’s a price we’ll have to pay
Don't they know that there's
Something they can do?
To be sure of tomorrow's tomorrow
And too late is too late for me and you
No more time left for you to borrow
And it’s too easy to turn a blind eye to the light
It’s too easy to bow your head and pray
But there are some times
When you should try to find your voice
And this is one voice that you must find today
Are you hoping for a miracle
As the ice caps melt away?
No use hoping for a miracle
There’s a price we’ll have to pay
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?


Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is
Dream on little dreamer
Follow all your signs
You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
And you know you got to go
Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Dream on, little dreamer
This is how it all begins
Move your feet
Feel how sweet it is
Dream on little dreamer
Follow all your signs
You got to gather up what you need
You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high

You got to choose a direction
And when the moment is right for you
You got to go
You got to keep your ideals high
You got to know that the sky belongs to no one
And you know you got to go
You got to go, you got to go
Dream on little dreamer
Follow all of your own signs
You got to go


My love is like first steps in this snow, baby
I follow you everywhere you go, baby
The palest light has come to wake you
But you will never realize
That I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby
I follow the winds that bring the cold, baby
I'll light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling
My love may be invisible
But I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby
You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star
Your singing satellite
Your singing satellite, your satellite
Your singing satellite
You're half a world away
I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that god sends
I'm flying high on my red-eye
And winding down down the window
My future is a Valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die
You're a half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star
Your singing satellite


There was a time there was a place
But there was fear inside
A witty line to save my face
A parachute of pride
To cross the line takes a tiny step

My fear entwined with my regret
I beat a path for safe return
There's a thing called love that we all forget
And it's a wasted love that we all regret

So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget
Forget about a thing called love
So here we are, we're just the same
And you will never know
My secret plan
How close we came
To share another road
And have I lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside?
Is it just me I'd like to know
Or are we all just a little blind?
There's a thing called love that we all forget
And it's a wasted love that we all regret
You live your life just once
So don't forget about a thing called love
Don't forget
Forget about a thing called love


Four thirty A.M, I'm awake again
Singing to the dark through open eyes
While dreaming I see only you and me
Stuck between desire and compromise
If I said I want you back I'd be a liar
There's nothing left of us to long for anymore
But inside the ashes burns an endless fire
And every night I can't help reaching out for more
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
You're leaving me scars scattered in my heart
A road map of all the places you have been
And I can't escape, can't wash this away
Love has burned your mark so deep within
If I said I want you back I'd be a liar
There's nothing left of us to long for anymore
But inside the ashes burns an endless fire
And every night I can't help reaching out for more
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep
And I can't sleep... You're so far away from me
And I can't sleep... And I can't sleep


It's raining, it's pouring
A black sky is falling
It's cold tonight
You gave me your answer - goodbye
Now I'm all on my own tonight
But when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win
We were in heaven, you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you
You'll never get over me
You held back and lost out
You gave in to each doubt
And walked away
A final embrace
You won't turn, I won't chase
Nothing more to say
But when the big wheel starts to spin
You can never know the odds
If you don't play you'll never win
We were in heaven, you and I
When I lay with you and close my eyes
Our fingers touch the sky
I'm sorry baby
You were the sun and moon to me
I'll never get over you
You'll never get over me


To be with you is easy
I know you're good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
To be with you is easy
I know you're good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, my love
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, oh love
To feel for you is easy - oh baby
I know you're good for me
This feeling inside me
Oh it sends me sky high
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, my love
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, oh love
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, my love
You're good for me, my baby
So good for me, oh love


I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call
Take my hand, take my hand, yeah, take my hand
Follow me, follow me, yeah, let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea, yeah, let's go
Out beyond the water's edge
Far out past the coral ledge
Underneath the diamond dancing lights
Chase the world from far below
Silence sleeping indigo
Drifting out into the endless night
I can not resist your call
I can not resist your call
Take my hand, take my hand, yeah, take my hand
Follow me, follow me, yeah, let's go
To the sand, to the sand, the purest sand
Into the sea, into the sea, yeah, let's go
Leaving reason far behind
Nothing here is cruel or kind
Only your desire to set me free
Let us lie here, all alone
Worn away like river stone
Let us be the sirens of the sea 
I can not resist your call


Well, I've had too many a
Good cry for you
Well, this is my time to say
Goodbye to you
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through
This is not yours alone
It hurts me too
Please don't say you don't care
I know you do
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through
Love is not enough for me
If it screams when you hold it
Love is not enough for me
Love is hurting if it screams
Oh, if it's screaming out loud
I've been screaming for love
Love is not enough
In my heart of hearts
I know there's more love left for you
But love is not enough, I've learned
To see the journey through


A little bit lost and a little bit lonely
Little bit cold here, a little bit of fear
But I hold on and I feel strong
And I know that I can
I'm getting used to it
Lit the fuse to it
Like to know who I am
I've been talking to myself forever, yeah
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah
Still sitting on a shelf and never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me on a good day
I'm a little bit hemmed in
A little bit isolated
A little bit hopeful
A little bit calm
But I hold on and I feel strong
And I know that I can
I'm getting used to it
Lit the fuse to it
Like to know who I am
I've been talking to myself forever, yeah
And how I wish I knew me better, yeah
Still sitting on a shelf and never
Never seen the sun shine brighter
And it feels like me on a good day


Slipping sideways, silver stars collide
And fade away just like our love that died
And there is nowhere in this universe to hide
From you tonight
I've wrestled with angels all my life
It's always the haloes and the wings
That keep you blind
And if I'd fought with all the strength I held inside
I wouldn't be out here
Alone tonight
I wouldn't be standing alone tonight
Alone tonight, just like the western star I'm sinking
The angels curse me blind with
Straight and crooked thinking
I've been crossing out the words I left unsaid
From the epilogue left lying in my head
Where there is poetry and tragedy unread
Until tonight
There's no other angel quite like you
They broke the mould, a thousand pieces icy blue
And though I tried to realign them - like I do
You went your own way
And I did too
So here I am
Alone tonight, just like the western star I'm sinking
The angels curse me blind with
Straight and crooked thinking


Time held its breath
A motionless spell of rapture
Across the room
A memory had been captured
And through the years
Though distance lay between us
I carried your torch
To illuminate the darkness
And I still lose myself
In that orange glowing moment
When your upturned face
Seemed to answer all my questions
But when I asked myself
As I do from time to time now
Where it all went wrong
Is there really any point in making plans?
In making plans?
So I made my vows
In the last low hours of morning
As I lay you down
I heard you whispering a warning
But then we lost ourselves
In that orange glowing moment
And your upturned face
Seemed to answer all my questions
But when I asked myself
As I do from time to time now
Where it all went wrong
Is there really any point in making plans?
In making plans?
And I still lose myself
I still lose myself
making plans


You tell me of a place you like to go
You say it will reach out and seize the sorrow
And we always mean to act on what we say
So come on, oh darling now... hurry, hurry, let's go
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
I told you of a place that I had been
It was dark and I was supremely alone
No matter now if the compass fails again
'Сause in your love I built a home
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need
We're all we need
We're all we need
We're all we need
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
We're all we need, oh darling
Most certainly I'm where I'm supposed to be
In a molten sun; with you I am free
Today our hearts won first prize
'Сause we're wise with the feeling
We're all we need


I get tired of life
What a world I'm living in
Now I've got it all
I've had enough, I'm giving in
The sun is shining
Melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning
This is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day
A king for a day
Stuck in this toxic town
It really takes my breath away
It's either leave or drown
I'm on a blue sky getaway
The sun is shining
Melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning
This is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day
A king for a day
The sun is shining
Melting the clouds away
Got me some blue sky action
I'm breathing today
I know I'm burning
This is my final day
I'm gonna go out smiling
A king for a day
A king for a day
A king for a day


I lost all my riches
The diamonds in the mind
It turns out that this was the best thing to ever happen to me
Errors and glitches
What a way to find
That such hurt could bring you greater peace of mind
Ooh, bring me peace of mind
Ooh, bring me peace of mind
If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you
If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you
If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you
If you've ever lost every part of yourself
If you've left your heart on a lonely avenue
It will be only a matter of time
Before your life comes through for you


I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you love me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you love me
I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you love me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you love me
Time is like a memory leaving lovers by your side
It only lets you keep the past alive in your mind
All I feel is silence now
Taking over, taking over, taking over
All I see is black clouds of doubt
Taking over, taking over, taking over
I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you love me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you love me
Time is like a memory leaving lovers by your side
It only lets you keep the past alive in your mind
All I feel is silence now
Taking over, taking over, taking over
I've been counting down the days and the nights
Since you last said that you love me
And it's cold here in the shadows with no light
Since you last said that you love me


We painted the picture you want
I wanted it too
But now there's something that I
Would like you to do
Get your sticky fingers out of my head.
Get your sticky fingers out of my head.
It's not that I'm ungrateful for
The chance to dream and then explore
But your elegant dinosaur limbs
Are still willfully bruising my skin
Get your sticky fingers out of my head.
Get your sticky fingers out of my head.
Get your sticky fingers out of my head 
(get your sticky fingers out of my head)


Too many hours on the road
Too many days as you grow older
And tears are spilled
As each moment unfolds
Your head is resting upon my shoulder
And I'm quietly thrilled
Did I miss that smile?
Did I miss that first step?
All the moments you're supposed not to forget?
You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me
I used to fear what you'd bring
I didn't know if I could love you
The way you'd deserve
You make me feel like a king
A day is no longer what I get through
You're my everything
Did I miss that smile?
Did I miss that first step?
All the moments you're supposed not to forget
You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me
You are my little something
It's like you came from nothing
And now you're everything to me
If I could turn back time
I'd be there for every minute
I'd give up the life I chose
Just to have you in it
If I could turn back time
I'd be there for every minute
I'd give up the life I chose
Just to have you in it


Maybe I have waited for too long
Maybe I got caught up in the storm
And I sent you off so incomplete
Now your lonely call is haunting me
And it's all over the world
Your call lost in the wind
You soar over the world
Your call over the world
All over the world
I've tried untethering my despair
Tried to forget and not to care
But the ropes that hold me are of stone
And your call it cuts me to the bone
And it's all over the world
Your call lost in the wind
You soar over the world
Your call over the world
All over the world
All over the world
It's all over the world
All over the world


You've been in my dreams
Right there in the seams
In the notes, in the fabric
In the way the day leans
There's so much I'd like to share with you
Share my arms
Share my time
Share almost anything that's mine
Except my fear of losing you
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know
You're part of me now
Known me somehow
Since birth
Since I fell down
Since you gave me my crown
It's too much to bear
Too much love there
Full of wonder
I will be free
You can see almost all of me
But not my fear of losing you
Oooh
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's most delicate lace
Lay down in Superman crystals of snow
But this is real life, don't you know?


Time held its breath

Where it all went wrong
Is there really any point in making plans?
In making plans
So I made my vows
In the last slow hours of morning
As I lay you down
I heard you whisper me a warning
But then we lost ourselves
In that orange glowing moment
And your upturned face
Seemed to answer all my questions
When I ask myself
As I do from time to time now
Where it all went wrong
Is there really any point in making plans?
In making plans
And I still lose myself
I still lose myself
Making plans


Your heart feels heavy now
The mist keeps rolling down
You never got that lucky break
They owe you, they owe you
Your friends have all left town
Your dreams are starting to drown
And you forgot that easy way
They showed you, they showed you
You are the one to blame
Living in total shame
Like the invisible man
You've got to stop as soon as you can
For all these excuses hear me well
You're making excuses
As you got to hell
And while it seduces
You're losing you chance
Stop making excuses
Just get up and dance
When there are things you gotta get out
Open the window and shout
You're gonna make your own luck
And show them, you'll show them
And while it all feels clearer now
You gotta kill that sacred cow
You gotta find the sun
And start growing, and glowing
You are the one to blame
Living in total shame
Like the invisible man
You got to stop as soon as you can
For all these excuses hear me well
You're making excuses
As you got to hell
And while it seduces
You're losing you chance
Stop making excuses
Just get up and dance
For all these excuses hear me well
You're making excuses
As you got to hell
And while it seduces
You're losing you chance
Stop making excuses
Just get up and dance


He wants to hold the children up high
When they come tearing through the rye
To save them from falling
To save them from falling
He wants to bring a little honey
To the saltiness of grief
To come up from underneath
You used to say that you would rescue me
But you yourself are lost at sea
Save me and I'll save you
Save me and I'll save you
Pave ways to get through together
Save me and I'll save you
Save me and I'll save you
Pave ways to get through together
Save me and I'll save you
Save me and I'll save you
Pave ways to get through together


When it comes calling
The temperature's falling
Our fear is crawling
Don't quit - we're all in
The ship's a mile out
Don't blow the lights out
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse
Since fear itself is
Cruel and selfish
A contradiction
A fatal addiction
You've tried to shout out
My words in your mouth
But they'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse
We're hot on the angels heels
With fire and brimstone wheels
Their meadow is starred
With bones and flowers and tears
The ship's a mile out
Don't blow the lights out
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse
With darkness closing
We're decomposing
We're made of starlight
From cruel and dark night
The guilty crushed out
We're left in no doubt
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse
We're hot on the angels heels
With fire and brimstone wheels
Their meadow is starred
With bones and flowers and tears
The ship's a mile out
Don't blow the lights out
They'll cry their eyes out
If we sink the lighthouse


Treasure is measured in units of love
Which means you may find you are rich
Beyond your wildest dreams
Beyond your wildest dreams
Beyond your wildest dreams
Beyond your wildest dreams
Treasure is measured in units of love
Which means you may find you are rich
Beyond your wildest dreams
Beyond your wildest dreams
Beyond your wildest dreams
Beyond your wildest dreams


Lo que a mi me pasa es una cama desecha
Una camisa arrugada y un sillón
Un teléfono que ya no suena
Un email que espero y que no llega
Y una cena triste junto al radiador
Lo que a mi me pasa eres tu
Porque ahora mi vida es un blues
Solo tu me puedes salvaaar
Vuelve conmigo, hoy mejor que mañana
A pintarme la lluvia, a cambiarme la cara
Vuelve conmigo a encender la bombilla
Que mi vida se apaga, que mi vida se apagaaaaa
Lo que a mi me pasa es mirar por la ventana
A las tres de la mañana y esperar
Madrugadas que son un infierno
Una manta grande en el invierno
Y una planta rara que se morirá
Lo que a mi me pasa eres tu
Porque ahora mi vida es un blues
Solo tu me puedes salvaaar
Vuelve conmigo, hoy mejor que mañana
A pintarme la lluvia, a cambiarme la cara
Vuelve conmigo a encender la bombilla
Que mi vida se apaga, que mi vida se apagaaaaa (bis)
Vuelve conmigo que de mi no me fio
A cogerme la mano, a quitarme este frio
Vuelve conmigo que sin ti no soy nada
Porque yo te lo pido vuelve conmigooo


¿Qué fue de aquella niña que hace tiempo yo guié
Que me miraba convencida?, ella alumna yo su ley.
¿Qué fue de aquella principiante que me lo daba todo?
De pronto se hizo adolescente y la guerra se inventó.
Me has ganado, me has vencido, derrotado, consumido,
Conquistado hasta mi último rincón. Todo ha cambiado.
Destronado con tu ejército de amor, me has hecho tuyo y
¿Dónde quedará mi orgullo? y ¿Dónde queda ya tu corazón?
Y pensar que éramos Romeo y Julieta y ahora soy tu marioneta.
Le deje al mando por un día, ella la guerra y yo el amor.
Se le olvidó que ella era mía y en mi trono se sentó.
Cambié hasta su filosofía, sus besos por los míos.
Cambié hasta el orden de la vida: primero ella y luego yo.
Me has ganado, me has vencido, derrotado, consumido,
Conquistado hasta mi último rincón. Todo ha cambiado.
Destronado con tu ejército de amor, me has hecho tuyo y
¿Dónde quedará mi orgullo? y ¿Dónde queda ya tu corazón?
Y pensar que éramos Romeo y Julieta y ahora soy tu marioneta.
Me has ganado, me has vencido, derrotado, consumido,
Conquistado hasta mi último rincón. Todo ha cambiado.
Destronado con tu ejército de amor, me has hecho tuyo y
¿Dónde quedará mi orgullo? y ¿Dónde queda ya tu corazón?
Destronado, mi amor.


Hoy es tan corto el atardecer
Nuestro beso en tu portal
Ya no es como el de ayer.
Hoy, no te diré hasta mañana
No sé cuanto estaré
Perdido en tu mirada.
No, ya sé que no es tan fácil
Como tenía en el pensamiento
De cuando llegara este momento.
Sí, también yo estoy disimulando
Sonrío y voy tranquilizando
La rabia de saber
Que por primera vez estaba amando.
Los dos cogidos de la mano
Por las calles
Y regalándonos mil besos en cada rincón
Te quiero así, sera, tal como eres, para mí.
No pidas más, que yo sea tu dueño, mi amor
Intentaré, parar la vida un instante
Para estar contigo, si puedo.
Pero después, al amanecer
No nos daremos ni cuenta pero en cada beso
Pondremos la vida, daremos el resto.
Eh! coge mi mano así sin miedo,
Bésame y no mires al suelo
El tiempo que aún nos queda,
Vivámoslo como si fuera eterno.
Los dos cogidos de la mano
Por las calles
Y regalándonos mil besos en cada rincón
Te quiero así, sera, tal como eres, para mí.
Los dos cogidos de la mano
Por las calles
Y regalándonos mil besos en cada rincón
Te quiero así, sera, tal como eres, para mí.


Dicen que antes los amantes eran más amantes
Y la luna les brillaba y ellos se enamoraban
Dicen que antes los detalles eran importantes
Y ves que ahora ya nada importa.
Dicen que antes declarar ese amor era elegante
Y cogerse de la mano era romántico y
Abrazarse bajo las estrellas y mandarse cartas bellas
Cada día eso yo querría..
Te propongo algo para recordar un amor
En blanco y negro sin final
Con un beso eterno como los antiguos
Y una noche de violines un delirio
Te propongo luna llena y estrellas
Yo te ofrezco amarte hacia la eternidad porque
A mí me han enseñado que una vez un no se da
Yo te ofrezco un amor como los de antes.
Quizás entonces las canciones eran más canciones
La nostalgia es mi bandera ...vuelvo en el tiempo
Y las prisas que hoy yo te amo lento
Te hago parte de mi cuento apasionado de
Mi amor soñado
Te propongo algo para recordar un amor en
Blanco y negro sin final con un beso eterno como
Los antiguos y una noche de violines un delirio
Te propongo luna llena y estrellas yo te ofrezco
Amarte hacia la eternidad porque a mi me han enseñado
Que una vez un no se da yo te ofrezco un amor...
Como los de antes....


Nunca he sentido nada igual contigo.
Hay algo más allá de ti y de mí y hoy ha venido.
Antes no sentía nada sólo te quería,
Cada beso que me dabas ya me lo sabía.
Y cuando ya creía que lo nuestro se moría
De repente miro al cielo y se hace el día.
Magia, que no hacen palabras,
Que luego todo es mentira
Hagámoslo con la vida,
Dejemos que hablen las hadas,
Dejemos que hablen la magia.
Magia, y con los cinco sentidos
Y los cuarenta latidos
Sentirnos desconocidos.
Nos hechizaron el alma
Ahora nos envuelve la magia.
Creí que no podía suceder, me equivoqué.
Que con un beso no podría resucitar un viejo amor.
Y hoy que todo lo improvisas todo me sorprende,
Cada movimiento que haces me apaga y me enciende.
Cuando ya creía que la perdimos para siempre
De repente el mismo cielo nos la devuelve.
Magia, que no hacen palabras,
Que luego todo es mentira
Hagámoslo con la vida,
Dejemos que hablen las hadas,
Dejemos que hablen la magia.
Magia, y con los cinco sentidos
Y los cuarenta latidos
Sentirnos desconocidos.
Nos hechizaron el alma
Ahora nos envuelve la magia.
Y lo dimos por perdido,
Lo fuimos dejando.
Casi ya desconocidos
Lo fuimos dejando.
Magia, que no hacen palabras,
Que luego todo es mentira
Hagámoslo con la vida,
Dejemos que hablen las hadas,
Dejemos que hablen la magia.
Magia, y con los cinco sentidos
Y los cuarenta latidos
Sentirnos desconocidos.
Nos hechizaron el alma
Ahora nos envuelve la magia.


Mientras brillen las estrellas y los rios corran hacia el mar hasta el dia en que tu vuelvas se que no te dejare de amar si escucharas mi lamento si me vieras volverias ya he pagado un alto precio por el mal que yo te hacia
Soy culpable ya lo se y estoy arrepentido te pido imaginame sin ti y regresaras a mi sabes que sin tu amor nada soy que no podre sobrevivir
Imaginame sin ti cuando mires mi retrato se algo en ti que da de mi regresa por favor
Imaginame sin ti se ha borrado mi sonrisa y la lluvia no ha cesado si supieras como duele no tenerte aquí a mi lado soy culpable a lo se y estoy arrepentido
Imaginame sin ti y regresaras a mi sabes que sin tu amor nada soy que no podre sobrevivir
Imaginame sin ti cuando mires mi retrato se algo en ti que da de mi regresa por favor
Imaginame sin ti  oh...ooooooh
Soy culpable ya lo se y estoy arrepentido te  pido
Imaginame sin ti y regresarasaas sabes que sin tu amor nada soy que no podre sobrevivir cuando mires mi retrato se algo en ti que da de mi regresa por favor
IMAGINAME SIN TI


En mi mente las hogueras ya se han apagado,
Y te busco necesito volver a tu lado
Es urgente el deseo se va haciendo fuerte
Cuantas veces me imagino volver a tenerte wooh
Volvería a sentirme tan cerca tan cerca de ti
Enredados de pies y de manos llegar hasta el fin
Pues tu corazón y mi corazón están solos
Si supieras que sin ti ya no me siento vivo
Olvidarte no me resulta sencillo noo
En mi pena lucho por no perderme en la arena
Del desierto que dejaste detrás al marcharte
Sin decirlo no
Volvería a sentirme tan cerca tan cerca de ti
Enredados de pies y de manos llegar hasta el fin
Pues tu corazón y mi corazón están solos
Viviría deprisa pensando que al fin tu vendrás
Esperando el momento perfecto que no llegara
Por tu amor mi corazón está roto roto
Volvería, volvería
Volvería a sentirme tan tan cerca de ti
Enredados de pies y de manos llegar hasta el fin
Pues tu corazón y mi corazón están solos
Viviría deprisa pensando que al fin tú vendrás
Esperando..


Me dijiste que te ibas
Y tus labios sonreían.
Mas tus ojos eran trozos del dolor.
No quise hablar,
Solo al final te dije adiós,
Solo adiós.
Yo no se si fue el orgullo,
O a que cosa lo atribuyo.
Te deje partir sintiendo tanto amor.
Tal vez hacía falta solo un por favor
Detente amor.
Uoooaaah
No se, vivir si no es contigo,
No se, no tengo valor.
No se, vivir si no es contigo,
No se, no se ni quien soy.
Desde el día que te fuiste,
Tengo el alma mas que triste,
Y mañana se muy bien
Va a ser peor.
Cómo olvidar ese mirar desolador.
Pero amor (aun queda amor, uhh).
No se, vivir si no es contigo.
No se, no tengo valor.
No se, vivir si no es contigo.
No se, no se ni quien soy.
No se, vivir si no es contigo.
No se, no se ni quien soy.
No se, vivir si no es contigo.
No se, no se ni quien soy.
No se, vivir si no es contigo.
No se, no se ni quien soy...


Para que sepas, cómo me siento,
Y te imagines, todo mi llanto.
Para que un día tú también veas en tus carnes padecer
Toda esta angustia que me has causado.
Para que sepas que llevo a fuego
Marcado una y otra vez este tormento,
Pues ya deshecho ya mi fe
Yo ya no estoy para entender,
No digas nada, no lo consiento.
Y ya sabes
Que en esta vida todo se acaba pagando
Y aunque te ocultes el destino habrá encontrado
Tus lágrimas de amor.
Y ya sabes
Que yo no estoy para servirte aquí a tu antojo.
Y te aseguro que derramarán tus ojos,
Más lágrimas de amor.
Para que sepas mi sufrimiento
Voy a decirte así de claro
Que no es tan fácil perdonar
A quien te tanto te hizo llorar
De eso recojas lo que has sembrado.
Para que entiendas lo que he pasado
Ahora soy yo quien te está despreciando
Ya no hay cabida para ti,
Cerré la puerta ya por fin,
Tú muerde el polvo y yo me aparto.
Y ya sabes
Que en esta vida todo se acaba pagando
Y aunque te ocultes el destino habrá encontrado
Tus lágrimas de amor.
Y ya sabes
Que yo no estoy para servirte aquí a tu antojo.
Y te aseguro que derramarán tus ojos,
Más lágrimas de amor.
Y ya sabes
Que yo no estoy para servirte aquí a tu antojo.
Y te aseguro que derramarán tus ojos,
Más lágrimas de amor.


Te amaré hasta engañar el tiempo,
El reloj ahora va marcha atrás.
Nadaré en la melancolía,
A un lugar que pueda respirar.
Soñaré que nada pasó
Que todo sigue igual
Que tú ya no te vas.
Te amaré en un mundo perfecto,
Donde no haya despedidas,
Donde no duelen las heridas.
Te amaré en un cielo inventado,
Paraíso de mi mente,
Un regreso al pasado.
Te amaré en mi máquina del tiempo
En mi fábrica de estrellas
La ciudad de cosas bellas.
Te amaré en un planeta raro
Donde no existen las leyes,
Donde estás siempre a mi lado.
Volveré besar lo desamado,
Recuperaré todas mis lágrimas.
Bucearé en un viaje encantado.
Rozaré te lloraré hacia atrás.
Soñaré castillos en el aire,
Que todo es como antes,
Que nunca se hizo tarde.
Te amaré en un mundo perfecto,
Donde no haya despedidas,
Donde no duelen las heridas.
Te amaré en un cielo inventado,
Paraíso de mi mente,
Un regreso al pasado.
Te amaré en mi maquina del tiempo
En mi fabrica de estrellas
La ciudad de cosas bellas.
Te amaré en un planeta raro
Donde no existen las leyes,
Donde estás siempre a mi lado.
Te amaré


Marta se ha marchado para no volver,
El tren de la mañana llega ya sin ella,
Es sólo un corazón con alma de metal,
En esa niebla gris que envuelve la ciudad.
Su banco está vacío, Marta sigue en mí,
La siento respirar, pienso que sigue aquí,
Ni la distancia enorme puede dividir
Dos corazones y un solo latir.
Quizá si tú piensas en mí,
Si a nadie tú quieres hablar,
Si tú te escondes como yo.
Si huyes de todo y si te vas,
Pronto a la cama sin cenar,
Si aprietas fuerte contra tí
La almohada y te echas a llorar
Si tú no sabes cuanto mal
Te hará la soledad.
Miro en mi diario tu fotografía
Con ojos de muchacha un poco tímida.
La aprieto contra el pecho y me parece que
Estás aquí, entre inglés y matemáticas.
Tu padre y sus consejos, que monotonía,
Por causa del trabajo y otras tonterías,
Te ha llevado lejos sin contar contigo,
Te ha dicho: "Un día lo comprenderás".
Quizá si tú piensas en mí,
Con los amigos te verás,
Tratando sólo de olvidar,
No es nada fácil, la verdad,
En clase ya no puedo más,
Y por las tardes es peor,
No tengo ganas de estudiar, por tí,
Mi pensamiento va.
Es imposible dividir así la vida de los dos,
Por eso, espérame, cariño mio...conserva la ilusión.
La soledad entre los dos,
Este silencio en mi interior,
Esa inquietud de ver pasar así la vida sin tu amor.
Por eso, espérame, porque
Esto no puede suceder,
Es imposible separar así la historia de los dos.
La soledad entre los dos,
Este silencio en mi interior,
Esa inquietud de ver pasar así la vida sin tu amor.
Por eso, espérame, porque
Esto no puede suceder,
Es imposible separar así la vida de los dos.


No sé si el mundo es el de siempre,
Pero yo, yo lo veo diferente,
Cuando tú no estás,
Cuando tú no estas,
No sé si brillan las estrellas,
Pero yo, yo me encuentro entre tinieblas,
Cuando tú no estás,
Cuando tú no estás.
Cuando tú no estás no tengo a nada,
No me queda más que mi dolor,
Por eso envidio al mar que tiene agua,
Y al amanecer que tiene el sol.
Nada soy sin Laura
Sólo estoy sin su amor.
Nada soy sin Laura,
Sin Laura, sin Laura, sin Laura, sin Laura.
No sé si es todo como antes,
Pero a mí, a mí me falta como el aire,
Cuando tú no estás,
Cuando tú no estás.
No sé si brilla igual la luna,
Pero yo la noche veo oscura,
Cuando tú no estás,
Cuando tú no estás.
Yo te busco a tí bajo las hojas,
Que cayendo estan cerca de mi,
Al otoño gris lleno de sombras,
Le preguntaré qué fue de ti,
Nada soy sin Laura
Sólo estoy sin su amor.
Nada soy sin Laura,
Sin Laura, sin Laura, sin Laura, sin Laura.
Sin Laura, sin su amor.

Quiero un mundo dibujado con Palomas de Picasso
con canciones de John Lennon en la punta de los labios.
Sigo aquí perdido en una ISLA,
todo lo que tengo es un papel.
Enviaré al mundo hoy un S.O.S
que decir en pocas líneas, no-lo-sé.
Lánzalo, que navegue pásalo!
que en las olas viaje la ilusión por UN MUNDO MEJOR
Lánzalo lo podemos intentar,
miles de botellas por el mar van llevando éste mensaje...
Lánzalo, lánzalo... lánzalo... woah, yeah...!
He escuchado el canto de sirenas,
he visto de lejos naufragar
tantos sueños presos de la am-bi-ción,
que al fin, no sé si es mejor vivir aquí o allí.
Lánzalo, que navegue pásalo!
que en las olas viaje la ilusión por UN MUNDO MEJOR
Lánzalo lo podemos intentar,
miles de botellas por el mar van llevando éste mensaje...
Lánzalo, lánzalo... lánzalo... woah, yeah...!
QUIERO UN MUNDO sin fronteras, sin banderas,
sin soldados disparando en las trincheras
a otros hombres asustados bajo leyes
de gobiernos pacifistas disfrazados
con oscuras ambiciones y sus cuentos tan baratos.
QUIERO UN MUNDO sin mentiras
que nos cuelan a diario poderosos que permiten
que se mueran mientras tanto,
sin escuela, medicinas, alimentos,
desahuciados alimentan la carrera de armamentos con descaro...
(QUIERO UN MUNDO sin prejuicios, sin racismo, más humano,
siendo todos tan iguales, el moreno y el más claro,
el que nace en esta tierra o el que llega de otro lado,
el que piensa de otra forma siempre a todos respetando...
QUIERO UN MUNDO dibujado con Palomas de Picasso,
con canciones de John Lennon en la punta de los labios,
con claveles en la boca de fusiles recortados,
con paisajes en los ojos de ese cielo limpio y claro...
QUIERO UN MUNDO sin los bosques por incendios arrasados
por los turbios intereses de unos cuantos desalmados,
sin basura sobre el agua de los ríos
que otros cuantos van vertiendo por
negocios sin remedio a su paso.)
Lánzalo, que navegue pásalo!
que en las olas viaje la ilusión por UN MUNDO MEJOR
Lánzalo lo podemos intentar,
miles de botellas por el mar van llevando éste mensaje...

Lánzalo.... woah... yeah....!
Lázanlo...
Lánzalo.... woah...
Sigo aquí perdido en una ISLA.


Cuando la ví supe que sería para mi
(Unbeliveable to realize)
No sé que hacer
¿Y si ella me dice que no?
(Was in heaven, was in paradise) 
Con ella puedo reir
Soy el más feliz
Del universo
(Across the universe)
Cuando ella no está 
No puedo pensar
No me puedo concentrar 
(And sometimes I lose my mind)
With her my heart starts to race
My head is saying cut to the chase
And so no matter what it takes
I gotta make the girl my girlfriend.
Hoy el corazón me va a estallar
Y no me atrevo a entrarle, ¿Que dirá? 
Pero no importa
Lo voy a lograr
Se que un día mi chica ella será
Traté de huirla
Traté de no mirarla más
(Well except to see her look at me)
Yo me acerqué y ¡Sorpresa!
No podía hablar
(Was she laughing? It's insanity!)
Con ella puedo reir
Soy el más feliz
Del universo
(Across the universe)
Cuando ella no está 
No puedo pensar
No me puedo concentrar 
(And sometimes I lose my mind)
With her my heart starts to race
My head is saying cut to the chase
And so no matter what it takes
I gotta make the girl my girlfriend.
Hoy el corazón me va a estallar
Y no me atrevo a entrarle, ¿Que dirá? 
Pero no importa
Lo voy a lograr
Se que un día mi chica ella será
No te lo pienses más
Eres fuerte para probar
(Yeah! Let's go)
Ella se hace querer
Sabes que lo puedes hacer
(Come on girl)
If I'm a joke, if I'm a loser
So what? She's it, the end.
Even if I get shot down
I've gotta do it
I've gotta tell her.
Sé mi girlfriend, girlfriend
Be my chica, chica
Se mi girlfriend, girlfriend
Be my girlfriend.
Hoy el corazón starts to race
Casi no puedo breath, I'm so amazed
No importa ahora what it takes
Porque hoy serás mi girlfriend
Hoy el corazón starts to race
Casi no puedo breath, I'm so amazed
No importa ahora what it takes
Porque hoy serás mi girlfriend
Porque hoy serás mi girlfriend


Me gustan tus defectos, te hacen mas humana
tu risa imperfecta, tu cara despejada
tus ojos aun dormidos, desnuda o en pijama
me gusta como eres recién levantada
Me gustas sincera y muy alocada
riendo por todo, llorando por nada
me gusta tu envoltorio de niña traviesa
me gusta tu ternura, tu olor a frambuesa
Tonight yo te quiero conquistar
tonight nadie nos podra separar
let your heart be free
feel my energy
come on beat with me, amor
tonight, tonight
let me ride with you
let me die on you
let me shake tu corazon
tonight, tonight
seras para mi
llegare hasta el fin
baby please don't get me wrong
Me gusta la lluvia cayendo en tu cara
me gustas salvaje y muy despeinada
me gustas completa, de pies a cabeza
me gustas cruda y de una sola pieza
Me gusta la sonrisa que ocultas tras los labios
tus ojos cerrados cuando nos enrollamos
me gusta como tiemblas entre mis brazos
tu risa nerviosa, tus manos sudando
tonight yo te quiero conquistar
tonight nadie nos podrá parar
let your heart be free
feel my energy
come on beat with me, amor
tonight, tonight
let me ride with you
let me die on you
let me shake tu corazon
tonight, tonight
seras para mi
llegare hasta el fin

Por la puerta aparecio,
yo jamas habia visto una chica asi.
Y sin mas me enloqueciò,
y en tan solo un segundo ella mi mundo cambió.
Me podia del suelo alguien levantar,
porque esta chica me acaba de marcar un touch down.
Ya no puedo dejarla marchar, que puedo hacer
si todo lo que hace ella es mágico.
Perdí el control no se puede escapar,
esque no lo puedo resisitir, esa chica es para mí.
Cuando camina, pierdo el control.
Y no me importa lo que digan si esta bien o mal.
Solo sus ojos puedo mirar,
y es que esa chica me ha cegado como la luz del sol.
Me podia del suelo alguien levantar,

La quiero tener solo para mí,
no puedo quedarme así.
Dejarla marchar,
que puedo hacer
si todo lo que hace ella es mágico.
Dejarla marchar,

Te intentado olvidar,
adentrandome en el mar.
Y en cada ola que cabalgo siempre estas.
En mi cabeza, en mi cabeza.
Azul profundo es tu amor,
y me a calado el corazón,
perdido en la marea no puedo volver.
En mi cabeza, en mi cabeza.
En mi cabeza sigues estando,
tu me estas ya intoxicando
y ahora paso los días solo,
haciendo surf y siempre estás ahi tú.
Me adentrado en aguas turbulentas,
huyendo de tu imagen que me atormenta.
De esta gran ola no se si saldre yo vivo,
en mi cabeza.
Un tsunami en mi interior,
a la deriva me dejó,
Y hasta la orilla la corriente me llevó.
En mi cabeza, en mi cabeza.
Abrí los ojos cielo azul,
y alli en la playa estabas tú.
Me has convertido en un esclavo de tu amor.
En mi cabeza.
En mi cabeza sigues estando,
tu me estas ya intoxicando
y ahora paso los días solo,
haciendo surf y siempre estás ahi tú.
Me adentrado en aguas turbulentas,
huyendo de tu imagen que me atormenta.
De esta gran ola no se si saldre yo vivo,
en mi cabeza.
Te he intentado olvidar centrandome en el mar,
y en cada ola que cabalgo, siem siempre estás
azul profundo es tu amor y me a calado el corazón.
AM
En mi cabeza, sigues estando
tu me estas ya intoxicando
y ahora paso los días solo,
haciendo surf y siempre estás ahi tú.

Tu eres la estrella que
me acompaño
de Madrid a Nueva York.
Tu debes ser la luz que
hace brillar
cada día mi corazón.
Desde que yo te vi
allá abajo cantar
mi corazón hace tic tac.
Porque te has convertido
en mi incondicional
el corazón me va a estallar.
Yo quiero volar hacia ti,
Yo quiero sentir tu calor,
Yo quiero poderte decir
que tu eres esa estrella
mi super estrella.
Ohhhh ohhhh
Tu siempre esta ay
mi soledad
cuando escribo una canción
mándame un twitt
y creo ser para ti
necesito ver tu luz
necesito hablarte.
Desde que yo te vi
ese día en twenty
mi corazón hace tic tac.
Por que te has convertido
en mi chica virtual
el corazón me va a estallar.
Yo quiero volar hacia a ti,
Yo quiero sentir tu calor,
Yo quiero poderte decir
que tu eres mi universo.
Yo quiero volar hacia a ti,
Yo quiero sentir tu calor,
Yo quiero poderte decir
que tu eres esa estrella
mi super estrella.
Ohhhhh Ohhhhh
Después de ti no hay mas
que oscuridad
yo te necesito porque
te has convertido en mi chica virtual
el corazón me va a estallar.
Yo quiero volar hacia a ti,
Yo quiero sentir tu calor,
Yo quiero poderte decir
que tu eres esa estrella.
Yo quiero volar hacia a ti,
Yo quiero sentir tu calor,
Yo quiero poderte decir
que tu eres esa estrella
mi super estrella.
Ohhhhh Ohhhh
Mi Super Estrella.


Más de mil años sin olerte
Más de mil años sin tú.. voz
pasó el verano y yo no olvido
ese día en tu habitación...
Esa luna llena tú cara serena
y yo muriendo de amor.
Sigues justo ahí, respirándome
y mi piel aún, sueña con tu piel
Podrían pasar más de mil años y seguiría añorándote
A fuego se marcó tu imagen, en piedras escribió tu amor
aquello fué una obra de arte, un momento de inspiración.
Y al día siguiente, fuí a buscarte urgente,
pero tu ser se esfumó y el tiempo se congeló.
Sigues justo ahí, respirándome
y mi piel aún, sueña con tu piel
Podrían pasar más de mil años y seguiría añorándote
Hoy desperté y ya no estabas
mi mente al fin se liberó...
está batalla está ganada, pero vuelve otra vez tú amor.


Quédate aquí a mi lado,
que no nos salga el sol,
ya estoy desesperado, tu piel mi piel están en confusión.
Arden ya tus caricias, ya no puedo esperar,
de mi solo cenizas quedarán niña si tú te vas.
If you leave me now, leave me now, me voy a evaporar
Leave me now, leave me now, de ganas morirás
If you love me now, love me now, no te arrepentirás
If you love me now, love me now, cause with me
All the girls say lalala.
Every time you get lonely lonely then just give me a go
All the girls say lalala.
Hoy suenan las sirenas,
yo ya no puedo más, el fuego por mis venas,
tu boca y yo se tienen que encontrar.
Hoy don't we stay together,
baby you are so hot,
recordarás forever, que tú y yo ardíamos de amor.
If you leave me now, leave me now, me voy a evaporar.
Leave me now, leave me now, de ganas morirás.
If you love me now, love me now, no te arrepentirás.
If you love me now, love me now, cause with me
All the girls say lalala.
Every time you get lonely lonely then just give me a go
All the girls say lalala.
Come on. Love me now, no te arrepentirás,
if you love me now, love me now, cause with me
All the girls say lalala.
Every time you get lonely lonely then just give me a go
All the girls say lalala [x3]


Miré en su interior
tratando de hallar
esa conexión que me hiciera volar.
Algo en su voz era irreal,
y el corazón se me iba a desbordar.
Y la luz se hizo en mi interior,
y subí como el sube el sol,
hasta el techo en mi habitación,
en mis ojos pronto algo despertó.
Comprendí que era tarde ya,
baby sé que ella siempre será
la primera y la última.
Y es que simplemente...
Eres como el aire.
Luz de luna tras su piel,
baby debes ser un ángel.
Nunca viví antes algo igual,
esa forma de amar niña no es normal.
Traté de respirar y recuperarme,
quise regresar al mundo terrenal,
pero su ser tiraba de mí,
y su gravedad me hacía repetir.
Nunca pude imaginar tanta sensibilidad,
sobran las palabras
entre tú y yo solo hay caridad.
Y la luz se hizo en mi interior,

Nunca viví antes algo igual,

Hey girl, no me sigas suplicando,
ya no con tus cuentos,
dejalo, tus lagrimas son un golpe de teatro.
Ya ves, me perdiste para siempre,
Para ti quizas no fui suficiente,
Apártate, que yo no soy, ni sere un segundo plato.
Te di mi alma y perdiste la calma,
Niña don't you think I'm blind
(don't you think I'm blind)
Te di mi abrazo Y me hiciste pedazos,
Noo baby leave me! (es lo que hay).
Her girl, todo terminó
Estas loca si tu crees
Que esto es cosa de tres, no,no
Leeme los labios: bye, bye, chao!
Hey girl, who you think I am?
Se acabo la fiesta ya
Despedirnos es vital,
Adios, esto ya se acabom
Niña déjalo,
see you baby en otros brazos.
You know you got - got what you're looking for,
You know you got - got what you're looking for,
You know you got - got what you're looking for,
so don't come around asking me for more.
Sabes que yo te he siempre confiado,
Y ya ves he salido trasquilado,
Mirame, now read my lips: que te de lo que has buscado.
Pensar que te ame como un ingenuo,
Y mi amor arrastraste por el suelom
Se acabo, y prueba tú el dolor que me has causado.
Te di mi vida
Y fuiste una niña
And it's a woman what I need, yeah.
Piensa: algun dia pudiste ser mia,
TÚ, Solo para mi.
Hey girl, todo terminó,
Estás loca si tu crees
Que esto es cosa de tres, no, no...
Léeme los labios: bye, bye, chao!
Hey girl, who you think I am?
Se acabo la fiesta ya, despedirnos es vital
Adios, esto ya se acabom
Niña déjalo,
See you baby en otros brazos.
Yo seré
El que te entrego su vida una vez,
Niña tú perdiste la ocasión.
Tú sera
Un recuerdo que jamas podre borrar,
Esa que yo ame y no me supo amar.
Her girl, todo terminó,
Estas loca si tu crees
Que esto es cosa de tres, nono..
Léeme los labios: bye,bye, chao!
her girl, who you think I am?
Se acabo la fiesta ya,
Despedirnos es vital,
Adiós esto ya se acabo,
Niña dejalo
See you baby en otros brazos.
You know you got - got what you're looking for,
You know you got - got what you're looking for,
You know you got - got what you're looking for,
so don't come around asking me for more.


Here we go again
Nothing ever changes
Same situation
I walk you through the stages
He's pulling on your heart strings
Making you change things
Your clothes, your friends
Messing with your head.
Tell me, how does he deserve your affection?
When there's so much more that I give to you
Tell me, how can I divide your attention?
Frustrating, can't take it
It's killing me, what can I do?
Put a gun against my head
Pull the trigger, hope I'm next
Beat me till I'm black and blue
Nothin' hurts as much as me not having you.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
Tears are running down your face
You're cryin' on my shoulder
Every day's a battle
Fighting like a soldier
To break down the walls that are keeping me out
I gotta show you how I'm feel in now
Where's the justice in this mad situation?
I can find the words to speak the truth now
Tell me how I'm gonna win your affection
Frustrating, can't take it Put a gun against my head
Pull the trigger, hope I'm next
Beat me till I'm black and blue
Nothin hurts as much as me not having you.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
Can't you see the damage?
Your fallin' for his games,
You just keep running back girl
And it's driving me insane.
Put a gun against my head
Pull the trigger, hope I'm next
Beat me till I'm black and blue
Nothin hurts as much as me not having you.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(It feels like) torture,
(It feels like) torture.
It feels like torture,
(Taste his poison) torture,
(Feel it running through her veins) torture,
(Dry her tears that pour like rain) torture,
(Watch her just go back again) it feels like torture.
Torture (Taste his poison)
(Feel her pain)
(Feel it running through her veins)
Baby, don't you treat me this way
(Dry her tears that pour like rain.)
It feels like.
It's killing me, what can I do?


Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
Quiero saltar sin miedo a tu boca,
Y caminar por la cuerda floja.
Hoy hasta el limite te voy a amar (te voy a amar).
Quiero domar a esa niña fiera,
Y demostrar que en el fondo es tierna,
Hoy soy el mago que te hará vibrar.
Baby, a ti me quiero lanzar,
Baby, lanzarme y no regresar,
Baby, siento que soy inmortal
Y que tú eres mi dama.
Baby, si no acierto,
Yo paso del cielo al infierno. (Ohh)
Pero ya mi miedo,
No existe el amor sin riesgo.
(Mi circo será)
Mi diversión, mi sonrisa, girl you know,
(Mi circo será)
Puro espectáculo es verte en acción.
(Mi circo será)
Mi diversión, mi sonrisa, girl you know,
(Mi circo será)
Puro espectáculo es verte en acción.
Saltaré a tu piel,
Sin temor, volaré.
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin,
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin,
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin,
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin.
Subiré al cielo de tus besos,
Y un salto mortal daré sobre tu cuerpo,
Sin duda alguna tú mi circo serás.
Baby, bajaré al fondo del mar,
Baby, encaminado a tu amor.
Baby, y trataré de escapar de tu boca, de tu voz, nooo..
Baby, sin tu abrazo
Soy solo un triste payaso. (Ohh)
Baby, sin tus labios
Yo nunca volaría tan alto.
(Mi circo será)
Mi diversión, mi sonrisa, girl you know,
(Mi circo será)
Puro espectáculo es verte en acción.
(Mi circo será)
Mi diversión, mi sonrisa, girl you know,

Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin,
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin,
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin,
Ladies and gentlemen the show must begin.


Te he tratado de olvidar,
camino sin mirar atrás,
pero a cada paso que doy,
comprendo que yo solo soy
un vagabundo sin tus besos.
Sobre una llama sin su luz,
mi sombra soy si no estas tú,
como un barco sin timón,
floto sin ton ni son,
me ahogo sin tu amor.
Volverte a amar,
se hace vital.
Jamás pensé yo que perderte
de esta manera iba a dolerme.
En mi horizonte siempre estarás,
salvo un sitio en mi corazón.
Just, another heartbreak,
si tú y yo pudiéramos seguir
prometo que no volveré a mentir.
Just, another heartbreak,
no creo que me pueda permitir
perderte de nuevo sería morir.
Yo quiero verte una vez más,
tal vez de amigos y ya,
si es que no nos queda amor.
Just, another heartbreak,
no creo que me pueda permitir
perderte de nuevo sería morir.
Trato de sobrevivir,
con el vacío que hay en mi,
me siento tan absurdo,
sin ti por este mundo
no sé seguir sin ti.
Volverte a amar se hace vital,

Aún no es demasiado tarde,
pero no me atrevo a llamarte,
pasaron meses y yo sigo aquí,
loco por ti...
Just, another heartbreak,
no creo que me pueda permitir
perderte de nuevo sería morir.
(Just, another heartbreak).
Uh, yeah.
No no...
(Just, another heartbreak).
Another heartbreak yeh, another heartbreak no (uh, uh oh..)
(Oh) Another heartbreak,

Mirarla es como soñar despierto,

Fue verte allí y yo sentir,
(Shake it boom boom,
Shake it boom boom)
Una atracción fatal.
En un segundo el corazón
(Shake it boom boom,
Shake it boom boom)
No podía controlar.
Viniste a mí (viniste a mí)
No supe huir (no supe huir)
Yo te adore,
Y noté que me faltaba el aire.
Me dejaste vacío y temblando.
No me queda ni siquiera el llanto.
Todo te lo dí,
Y ahora sé que fue un error amarte.
Me robaste la fina esperanza,
Del amor yo ya no quiero nada,
Menos hacia ti.
Y Ahora sé que fue un error amarte.
(Fue, fue, fue)
Fue un error amarte.
(Fue, fue, fue)
Fue un error amarte.
(Fue, fue, fue, fue)
Fue un error amarte.
Fue un error amarte.
Pronto en mi carne descubrí
(Shake it boom boom,
Shake it boom boom)
Que tu nombre era traición.
Entre tus dedos solo fui
(Shake it boom boom,
Shake it boom boom)
Un patético bufón.
Dormí en tu piel (dormí en tu piel)
Y mi corazón (y mi corazón)
No despertó,
Porque baby...
Loving you so heartbreak
Me dejaste vacío y temblando,
No me queda ni siquiera el llanto.
Todo te lo dí,
Y ahora sé que fue un error amarte.
Me robaste la fina esperanza,
Del amor yo ya no quiero nada.
Menos hacia ti.
Y ahora sé que fue un error amarte.
Me perdí en tu cuerpo y ya no pude salir,
Me enganché a tus labios, luego me dejaste así.
Un juguete roto,
Un despojo,
Un animal.
Que subsiste de las obras que dejaste atrás.
Me perdí en tu cuerpo y ya no pude salir,

En el fondo de su alma
hay un grito que no calla
esa luz en su interior
es mi luz, es la luz de los dos
aunque no le ponga nombre
yo conozco bien su corazón
ella es todo lo que soy
su calor, es mas fuerte que el sol
she's golden heart, golden heart
pequeña pero con un corazón de titan
me abraza con su alma y yo la puedo notar
me manda con su pensamiento una señal
te siento respirar, my golden heart
hay un sitio en este mundo
donde solo estamos ella y yo
es el centro de su ser
es paraíso que siempre busqué
si pudiera yo ponerme en su piel un segundo
comprendería como es el amor mas puro
she's golden heart, golden heart
pequeña pero con un corazón de titan
me abraza con su alma y yo la puedo notar
me manda con su pensamiento una señal
te siento respirar
she's golden heart, golden heart
pequeña pero con un corazón de titan
me abraza con su alma y yo la puedo notar
me manda con su pensamiento una señal
te siento respirar
my golden heart
my golden heart
my golden heart
my golden heart


Tú siempre juegas con mi corazón,
y yo ya no puedo más
(y yo ya no puedo más).
Niña contigo ya no sé quien soy,
baby tell me who I am (who I am).
Sabes que puedo ser
el ángel que te abraza al amanecer,
baby please tell me who I am,
baby please tell me who I am.
Baby yo puedo ser
el chico malo que te hace enloquecer,
baby please tell me who I am,
baby please tell me who I am
I am, ese que mueres por él,
o el que no quieres ni ver,
el que te hace vibrar
o el que ya te aburre besar.
Al cielo me haces llegar,
o me llenas de soledad,
a veces me agrumas de amor,
y otras soy tu bufón.
(Tell me who I am)
who I am, who I am.
Niña en tus manos siento que yo soy
un muñeco de papel (un muñeco de papel).
Solo un juguete roto sin control,
baby tell me who I am (who I am)
(oh, oh, oh)
Sabes que puedo estar
las veinticuatro horas adorándote,
baby please tell me who I am,
baby please tell me who I am.
Si quieres puedo intentar
hacerme el fuerte y ya no llamarte más.
Baby please tell me who I am
baby please tell me who I am.
I am, ese que mueres por él,
o el que no quieres ni ver,
el que te hace vibrar,
o el que ya te aburre besar.
Al cielo me haces llegar,
o me llenas de soledad,
a veces me agrumas de amor,
y otras soy tu bufón,
(tell me who I am)
Para tener, para tener tu amor
dime girl, quien debo ser yo
para llegar hasta tu corazón.
(Who I am)
Para tener, para tener tu amor
dime girl, quien debo ser yo
para llegar hasta tu corazón
Who I am.
Ese que mueres por él,
o el que no quieres ni ver,
el que te hace vibrar,
o el que ya te aburre besar.
Al cielo me haces llegar,
o me llenas de soledad,
a veces me agrumas de amor,
y otras soy tu bufón.
(Tell me who I am)
Para tener, para tener tu amor
dime girl, quien debo ser yo.

Baby, mírame,
noto que tu voz
tiembla y algo está ocultando.
Habla, no hay dolor,
miénteme otra vez
no me importa yo me hago el
Loco, ciego, por tus besos
Dentro llevo un pobre corazón que no sabe latir sin ti
Te llevaste mi dinero y este corazón
lo arrastraste por el suelo y soy un perdedor (perdedor)
Qué más da
Me resbala el qué dirán
Y nada importa porque soy adicto a ti (solo a ti)
Tell me that you love me
Que sino me muero
Tell me that you need me
Que sino reviento
Puedes disparar, haz de mí
un despojo no me importa
Baby, sabes bien que de ti yo me creo todo
y me hago el
Loco, ciego, por tus besos
Dentro llevo un pobre corazón que no sabe latir sin ti
Te llevaste mi dinero y este corazón
lo arrastraste por el suelo y soy un perdedor (perdedor)
Qué más da
Me resbala el qué dirán
Y nada importa porque soy adicto a ti (solo a ti)
Tell me that you love me
Que sino me muero
Tell me that you need me
Que sino reviento
Te llevaste mi dinero y este corazón
lo arrastraste por el suelo y soy un perdedor (perdedor)
Qué más da
Me resbala el qué dirán
Y nada importa porque soy adicto a ti (solo a ti)

Tell me that you love me
Que sino me muero
Tell me that you need me
Que sino reviento


AM, baby, AM.
Es por su manera de mirar,
Por sus ojitos de ingenuidad,
Que ella está fuera de la ley,
Y yo soy forajido en su piel.
Esa boca hoy, es mi perdición,
No deben saber, que muero por tu amor.
Cause you're mine, oh mine,
Ya no puedo resistirme, you are so fine.
Baby, jamás sabrán
que tú eres mi baby girl.
Subiré a la cima de tu piel,
Por tu nieve blanca esquiaré,
Yo quiero llegar a ese lugar,
Que nunca nadie antes pudo pisar.
Te recorreré, sin miedo a caer,
Mi delito es, amarte sin cuartel.
Cause you're mine, oh mine,
Ya no puedo resistirme, you are so fine.
Baby, jamás sabrán
que tú eres mi baby girl.
Subiré a la cima de tu,
Bucearé en las olas de tu,
Llegaré hasta el centro de tu co-ra-zón.
Probaré el sabor hoy de tu,
Mojaré el secreto de tu,
Llegaré hasta el centro de tu co-ra-zón.
Te recorreré, sin miedo a caer,
Mi delito es, amarte sin cuartel.
Cause you're mine, oh mine,
Ya no puedo resistirme, you are so fine (you are so fine),
Baby, jamás sabrán
que tú eres mi baby (mi baby girl, tu eres mi
Baby girl).
Cause you're mine, oh mine,
Ya no puedo resistirme, you are so fine (you're so fine),
Baby, jamás sabrán
que tú eres mi baby girl.


Ella solo es aire,
Una obra de arte,
Que cruza mi alma,
Como un huracán.
Ella es luna nueva,
Que en mi pecho juega,
En silencio me ama,
Y después se va.. Mmm...
Irreal, viene y va,
Y no la puedo alcanzar.
¿Dónde está esa niña indeterminada
Que me da su aliento y me hace gozar?
¿Dónde está esa que yo sueño en mi almohada?
I feel you'll be mine, you'll be mine, mine.
Hoy quiero inventarte,
Y a mi cuerpo anclarte,
Cerraré las puertas,
No te esfumarás.
Es cuestión de tiempo,
Que te robe un beso,
Surge de la niebla,
Y hazte realidad.. Mmm...
Irreal (uu), viene y va (uuu),
Y no la puedo alcanzar (nooo).
¿Dónde está esa niña indeterminada
Que me da su aliento y me hace gozar?
¿Dónde está esa que yo sueño en mi almohada? (en mi almohada)
I feel you'll be mine, you'll be mine, mine.
¿Dónde está esa niña indeterminada (indeterminada)
Que me da su aliento y me hace gozar?
¿Dónde está esa que yo sueño en mi almohada?
(¿Dónde está? ¿Dónde está?)
I feel you'll be mine, you'll be mine, mine.
¿Dónde está esa niña indeterminada? [x4]
Irreal (uu), viene y va (uuu),
Y no la puedo alcanzar (nooo).
¿Dónde está esa niña indeterminada
Que me da su aliento y me hace gozar?
¿Dónde está esa que yo sueño en mi almohada? (en mi almohada)
I feel you'll be mine, you'll be mine, mine.

Que me da su aliento y me hace gozar?

I feel you'll be mine, you'll be mine, mine.

Tengo frío en el corazón,
Dame luz, dame amor,
Que ésta noche no salga el sol,

Don't need no TV, I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing
All I need is time for the simple life
Go get your butt out off that lazy couch
Put down the laptop and get out of the house
Don't need no nothing
All I need is time for the simple life
I got a brand new scratch on my Cadillac
Try to call the Bodyshop but my phone is dead
Tried to email my brother but the wifi's down
This stuff is haunting me all year round
I'm fixing one thing and another one's coming lose
It's making me think how much it stinks
I keep on buying new things that I can't really use
If it just gets you annoyed then what is the point?
Don't need no TV, I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing
All I need is time for the simple life
Go get your butt out off that lazy couch
Put down the laptop and get out of the house
Don't need no nothing
All I need is time for the simple life
I'm taking one step forward and three steps back
Kick myself for letting go of the things I had
Guess you don't know what you got till that junk goes bad
Never should have dumped that hand me down I got from dad
I'm solve one problem and another one's popping up
Ain't it ironic how the problem get's chronic
'Cause when you got it good you just don't know when to stop
Don't worry 'bout the earning if it stops you from living
Duhm Duhm Duhm's and Scooby doo's
Don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing
All I need is time for the simple life
Don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing
All I need is time for the simple life
Go, get your butt out off that lazy couch
Put down the laptop and get out of the house
It doesn't hurt if you would try
Some times it's the simple life


I'm not scared of ghosts no more
Not afraid of the dark anymore
Went to that haunted house and opened that door
But I'm still the same with you
Don't put my muddy shoes on the kitchen floor
Don't even double knot them anymore
Finally found out what a painkiller's for
But I'm still the same with you
I kept you hidden up inside
But you're far too beautiful to hide
I've changed in every way I knew how to
But I'm still the same with you
Don't wear my heart on my sleeve these days
Guess I got tired of it getting misplaced
Found out that love is too precious to waste
But I waste it all on you
Always traveling, I'm going somewhere
Any road I take is leading me here
Everything I do is up in the air
But I'm still the same with you
I kept you hidden up inside
But you're far too beautiful to hide
I've changed in every way I knew how to
But I'm still the same with you
You're the rock in the center of my universe
You're the second and third chance I don't deserve
I can be what I want but I know who I am
With you I'm not scared of ghosts no more
Not afraid of the dark anymore
Went to that haunted house
You were waiting by that door
And I'm still the same with you
I can keep you hidden up inside
And you're far too beautiful to hide
I can change in every way I know how to
But I'm still the same with you


Girl you, hit me harder than a freight train
Right in the middle of my membrane
Driving backwards in the fast lane
Headlights off after midnight
Saw you shinning in the starlight
Girl you got me like a bug bite
And now you're under my skin
And I know, you know, I don't know which way to go to lose you
To get away from you girl
Lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Just get out, get out, get out, get out
Play me, like boy you never gonna get me
You're just lucky that you met me
I'll make sure you don't forget me again
And I don't what I would do if I was without you
Even though I am, I'm always thinking about you
Spending all my weekend forgetting about you
But you're under my skin
And I know, you know, I don't know which way to go to lose you
To get away from you girl
And lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
G-g-get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
And I'm lying alone in my bed
Wondering why love makes me feel like I'm dead
Baby, you gave me a taste now I'm wasted
Lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Oh, lately, I've been going crazy
Cause I want you baby
But you don't, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cause I'm breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I can't have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Just get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart


Throw the maps, oh, let's get lost
Nothing matter but the two of us
All the will for us to see
Let's gonna find a little mystery
Dig, I toss until the open road
We go in through this great bright morning
Leave the rest of this world behind
Falling into this great bright morning
You and I, you and I
Treat me like a best friend
We don't have to speak at all
Counting clouds and chasing dreams
Through the streams and water falls
Dig, I toss until the open road
We go in through this great bright morning
Leave the rest of this world behind
Falling into this great bright morning
You and I, you and I, oh, oh
We go in through this great bright morning
Leave the rest of this world behind
Falling into this great bright morning
You and I, you and I
We go in through this great bright morning
Leave the rest of this world behind
Falling into this great bright morning
You and I, you and I


You Try to analyze, think about your allibi
before you break your own curfew
And try to work your way out of something you can't stop
Because you're already into 
So weak on your feet you're fallin' for me
no way to escape now
'cause there ain't no use, don't need no excuse
to stick around 
Don't blame it on the moon that pulls you close up 
your head or your heart, don't blame it on love
just blame it on me
Don't blame it on a kiss on the kitchen sink 
baby it's easier then you think 
just blame it on me 
Being intoxicated is a little overrated
if you're looking for an answer 
I could get lost in those eyes all night
Until I make you surrender
Soon morning will come 
you're gonna come undone
And you don't wanna leave now
Baby tell me the truth
There's only one excuse to stick around
Don't blame it on the moon that pulls you close up 
your head or your heart, don't blame it on love
just blame it on me
Don't blame it on a kiss on the kitchen sink 
baby it's easier then you think 
just blame it on me 
Oh no it's happening again 
I think we're more then friends
I'll make you think of a reason
Why I won't let you leave
Don't blame it on the groove of a saturday night
Don't blame it on the wrong when it's right
Don't blame it on the moon...
Blame it on me
Don't blame it on a kiss on the kitchen sink
Blame it on me, blame it on me 
Don't blame it on the moon that pulls you close up 
your head or your heart, don't blame it on love
just blame it on me 
just blame it on me
oh don't blame it on a kiss on the kitchen sink
oh baby it's easier then you think
ooh ooh 
you gotta blame it on me
you gotta blame it on me
blaming nobody else just me
you gotta blame it on me
you gotta blame it on me...
blame it on me


When I saw you in that window
I should have kept walking by
Heart slows down my paces
Temptress lures me inside
Temperature is rising, mhm
Gotta take off my tie
Felt your tongue with the [?]
As I slipped it all in
A shoveling up so high,
Without your love around
My feet drag on the ground
I just wanna take you on
But as time keeps moving on
Your shine is clearly gone
This just ain’t going nowhere
I thought you were the one,
I didn’t mean it, oh,
I tried those new shoes on
You should have seen it
Oh, your experience is wrong
But your comfort is not enough
You know baby you really wore out my soul
Wore out my soul
When I walked with you, it used to feel so sweet
People would see us together, I was complete
Mama used to say I’ll go out of you one day
I thought I’ll be with you till we were old and grey
Without your love around, I thought I’d feel so down
I thought I’d be crying all the time
But as time kept moving on,
You surely [?] clearly gone
I knew that I’d walk out all over you, whoa!
I thought you were the one,
I didn’t mean it, oh,
I tried those new shoes on
You should have seen it
Oh, your exterior is rough
But your comfort is not enough
You know baby you really wore out my soul
Wore out my soul
I thought you were the one,
I didn’t mean it, uh, uh
I tried those new shoes on
You should have seen it
Oh, your exterior is rough
But your comfort is not enough
You know baby you really wore out my soul
Wore out my soul
Oh, I thought you were the one,
I thought you were the one,
I tried those new shoes on
You should have seen it
Oh, your exterior is rough
But your comfort is not enough
You know baby you really wore out my soul.


Stuck in London, gotta make some dough
Lost my beard and I lost my fro
Looking high and I'm looking low
But there ain't no pretty girls no more
I saw a girl who had a perfect smile
But she wasn't you and I got bored after a while
But I'll be fine, I got this picture in my mind
You and me, riding the train to our destiny
You and me, eating mangoes in a mango tree
There is nothing that I would not do
To be on plane going straight to you
The bank said the payments didn't come through
So I'm stuck working in the London zoo
I help the kids get on the carousel
But baby, at night it's like a living hell
But I'll be fine I got this picture in my mind
You and me, riding the train to our destiny
You and me, eating mangoes in a mango tree
Humba duh dumbah humbah's
You and me, riding the train to our destiny
You and me, making love with this melody
You and me, we drink coffee 'cause we don't drink tea
You and me, eating mangoes in a mango tree
Eating mangoes in a mango tree
Eating mangoes in a mango tree
Eating mangoes in a mango tree
Eating mangoes in a mango tree


Saw you on a subway in New York City
Called across the platform but no, you didn't hear me
You took my heart but never left my brain
You're headed up to Harlem on a uptown train
Before that night everything was black and white
And I wanna tell you right now
You're the kinda girl Ray was singing about
I know it sounds crazy, don't know how in this world
But I found my midnight girl
You're friends all wondering what I'm doing round here
I know they're probably wishing that I just disappear
And I know I hear them laughing when I'm out of the room
You can tell them I ain't leaving anytime soon
'Cause you know this life isn't so black and white
And I wanna tell you right now
You're the kinda girl Ray was singing about
I know it sounds crazy, don't know how in this world
But I found my midnight girl
They all say we're from two different worlds
I'ma say we're a boy and a girl
Call me crazy but it's all the same to me
And I wanna tell you right now
You're the kinda girl Ray was singing about
I know it sounds crazy, don't know how in this world
But I found my midnight girl


I met her on the day of New Year's Eve
I was shopping for a wedding gift on Buena Vista street
I swear I saw the fire in her eyes
The kind of girl you hear about but never see in real life
Everyone needs something, everyone wants love
She's lying in my bed in just her underwear
She's laughing at the words I say
Yeah, we're kissing and we're touching
Underneath the covers listening to Marvin Gaye
I hear her whispering I love you right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream, a boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream, a boy can dream, dream, dream
Now I woke up on Sunday afternoon
I had to drive back, I was hoping I would see her soon
Is something about the way she looked at me
She keeps playing in my head like a broken record on repeat
Everyone needs something, everyone wants love
She's lying in my bed in just her underwear
She's laughing at the words I say
Yeah, we're kissing and we're touching
Underneath the covers listening to Marvin Gaye
I hear her whispering I love you right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream, a boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream, a boy can dream, dream, dream
If only I had her number I know later on tonight
She'd be lying in my bed in just her underwear
She's laughing at the words I say
Yeah, we're kissing and we're touching
Underneath the covers listening to Marvin Gaye
I hear her whispering I love you right before I fall asleep
A boy can dream, dream, dream, a boy can dream, dream, dream
A boy can dream, dream, dream, a boy can dream, dream, dream
I met her on the day of New Year's Eve


Yeah, I’m a mess, I’m about to strike
Another cover of a candlelight
Who said that I need to sleep tonight, tonight?
I’m a wheel, I was born to roll
I got no breaks, I got no control...
Heaven help me take it slow, tonight. 
Cause she got my head turning
She got my fire burning
So hot the rain is falling...
Can't you tell! It's been a dry spell.
I’mma get down with just one string
But I bet you I can make her swing
She’s gonna hang on my everything tonight
She’s the fever that I just can’t fight
It’s like I’m playing with dynamite
She’s gonna come home with me tonight, tonight!
Cause she got my head turning
She got my fire burning
So hot the rain is falling...
Can't you tell! It's been a dry spell.
She's an ice cold lemonade on a hot summer day
A melody so sweet she takes my blues away
That little red dress is getting under my skin
She knows, she knows how the real me in
She loves to drive me crazy, so I’m out of my mind
She’s going fast to go forward while I’m still in rewind
You don’t really know me, but hey, can you tell?
It’s been a long, long, dry spell!
Oh baby, it’s been a long dry spell!
I’m a match, I’m about to strike
Under the cover of a candle light
Who said that I need to sleep tonight
Oh, oh, tonight!
Oh, she got my head turning,
She got my fire burning
So hot the rain is falling
I just can’t stop falling![x4]


I hear you wanna say something to me
You know what I gonna say
I don’t know what she tell me right now
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
What you say?
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
Woah, woman, this woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you said so
I have to pack my things and go
That's right!
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
Oh, baby! Don’t you make me leave
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
Oh baby, listen, baby, don't you treat me this way
Cause I'll be back on my feet someday
I don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
You ain't got no money you just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
‘Cause have to pack my things and go
That's right
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
I guess why, guess why, guess why
That’s really how you feel?
Yes, you know is how I feel
Guess why
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
What you say?
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
What you say?
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more,
no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack and don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more [x9]
Don’t you come back no more


Hi de ho, hi de hi
Gonna find me a piece of that sky
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Singing, hi de, hi de, hi de, hi de ho
I've been down so long
That the bottom looked like up
Once I felt like second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I have
But it ain't no way to live
Being taken by the ones
Who have the least amount to give, oh yeah
Hi de ho, hi de hi
I'm gonna find me a piece of that sky
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Singing, hi de, hi de, hi de, hi de ho
I wanna tell you
Once I met the devil, he was mighty slick
He tempted me with worldly goods
Said that I could have my pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign
I said, "Thank you very kindly, sir
But I'm too great a-need of mind"
Singing, singing hi de, hi de ho
Hi de, hi de, hi de oh
I gotta get me a piece of that big old sky
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Hi de, hi de, hi de hi
Oh mama, why oh, why oh, why?
Singing hi de, hi de, hi de, hi de ho
Let's hit 'em one more time
Oh yeah, baby
Gonna find me some of that old sweet roll
Singing, hi de, hi de, hi de hi
Hi de, hi de, hi de hi
Hi de, hi de, hi de, hi de ho, oh


I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around
Oh baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darling, I can't stand it
When you look at me that way
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around
Oh darling, when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are something, I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby
I've just got to have you, baby
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I just lose control
Down to my very soul
I get hot and cold all over
All over, all over, all over
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling d-d-down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down
Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down


Stop!
She was banging
But lovin' was cold
Keep it up, it's going
to be a love TKO
Trying to find my direction
Instead of feeling the love
You break it all down into section[BRIDGE]
Cos I want you baby
And I need you lady
Don't stop acting shady
Take a detour
I'm singing to you lady[CHORUS]
What's the matter, don't 
you love me (Tell me now)
Don't you really care now
(care about you)
Oh, I'm about to lose 
my mind with your stop sign
I didn't mean to get myself
so involved
Second time around back
round we go
It feels right when I'm next to you
So why you gotta make me so blue
She's telling me
Why
She's thinking that she
needs another
Guy
Somebody that ain't gonna
make her
Cry
Well lady I can be that
But your stop sign's not letting
you see that
Why won't you let me hold you
(Hold you tight)
In my warm embrace
(Sweet embrace)
Why won't you let my love shine
In your stop sign [*2]
Oh no check the flow
You ready with the base
Let's go
My sound abstract
Cut the loop and bring the
beat back
Bounce to the hot new flavour
Turn up the high end on the
system fader
It ain't that I hate you
But I don't wanna know
Yo, I'll see you later[BRIDGE][CHORUS]
Why won't you let me hold you
(Hold you tight)
In my warm embrace
(Sweet embrace)
Why won't you let my love shine
In your stop sign (I love you baby)
In your stop sign
(I need you baby)
In your stop sign
(I want you baby)[REPEAT 3 TIMES]


Abs...
Nodesha...
Shorty, c'mon, uh
Oh my, you was looking so down
When I first met you
I bet you didn't think it would get to a situation when I'd let you,
Just go, so that you let me know,
Why you're acting cold?
Thinking about words that you told me
When you phoned me
She was saying
No, No, No
I'm moving into something new
(Oh girl what you wanna do?)
Saying woah, boy slow,
I got a hundred other things to do
Before I go just tell me[CHORUS 1 - Abs only]
Little Miss Perfect
Was she worth it?
A dangerous game she had to play,
She could've deserted but she flirted,
Now little Miss Perfect's gone away.[CHORUS 2]
Little Miss Perfect
Was she worth it?
A dangerous game she had to play,
She could've deserted but she flirted,
Now little Miss Perfect's gone away.
Oh no, gonna do it again,
Gonna find myself right back up where I started lady,
Baby girl it ain't hard to tell
That you wanna get your flirt on,
Cos you got your boots and your skirt on, (mm-mmmm)
When you're looking like that,
I think I want you back. (yeah)

Don't even try to step to me
(Oh girl what you wanna do?)
Saying woah, boy slow,
Can't stop this curiosity
Before I go just tell me[CHORUS 2 x2]
Saying what, you forgot?
Baby stop
You were out at 10 o'clock
On the rocks, getting hot, hot, hot
Is that where you're at?
Got the mack
She's just falling for your chat,
Dirty rat, now you're back, back, back.
No, No, No
I'm moving into something new
(Oh girl what you wanna do?)
Saying woah, boy slow,
I got a hundred other things to do
Before I go just tell me[REPEAT CHORUS 2 TO END]


[INTRO]
Y'know... I got a girl... but.. still
Hit the block around twenty to nine,
Checkin' my girl
But then I see this girl lookin' fine, so I
Asked her if she wouldn't mind,
Could you tell me your name and what you're doing tonight?
Body like nothin' I seen, 
She's telling me she's on the cover of GQ magazine.(is that right)
Tellin' me she had to go...
So I dropped her right the spot in my four by four[BRIDGE]
So I told her...
I can't be late,
The girl's taking up my time,
Had to hit her with a line,
So I told her...
I can't wait to freak,
See you at the same time next week.
She said...[CHORUS]
Baby give me what you got,
Cos I'm everything that's she's not.
Love is all I bring,
In my khaki suit and ting.
So honey leave your girl at home,
With your car keys, mobile phone.
Love is all I got,
All the things that make you hot...
Got my woman crazy on the phone,
She's talking bout why the f*** my ass ain't at home.
Had to tell her I was stuck,
In some brand new business, I was all tied up.
Told the girl I was late,
I had to rhyme.
I got to be backstage at a quarter past nine.
Telling me to change my mind...
She's like Britney Spears Baby hit me one more time[BRIDGE][CHORUS][BRIDGE][CHORUS]

I don't know bout you, 
But I came here to party, yeah 
Tonight is your night, gonna find yourself somebody 
(Yo what your gonna say) [Bridge]
I say hey pretty girl, 
Do you wanna dance the night away, 
But you don't wanna fall in love, 
If you said that fault you any day[Chorus]
Cause I'm feeling the heat, 
Won't you get yourself close to me, 
When you move to the beat, 
It's the ultimate fantasy, girl 
(Back to the Limbo) 
Mama say, mama sa, 
Switch the cross radar
And let me come a little nearer, 
So you can here what I sing, just a little clearer 
I like the way you move, 
The little things you do, 
You begging me want to, come dance with you 
Would you mind if I asked you to [Bridge][Chorus]
I'm feeling so damn limbofied, 
With your hot lips, and your limbo thighs, 
Don't stop! 
Give me the sign and I come running back, 
Sam and Dave, hold on I'm coming, 
Ha Ha Ha And He, back to back let me shift the gear, 
Turn up the system, and get ready to roll, 
Reverse your back sack, let me lose control, while out 
I'm the girl with the light eyes 
Ey miss is everybody I'm feeling the block, 
And it's good being here with you, 
And if your feeling the same, 
Let me hear you oeeh [Chorus]
Clap your hands, 
Take it up front and to the side, 
Knot your head, 
Can you feel what my body sent you now, 
Stop your feet, I wanna see you shake, 
And bring it back down low, nice and slow 
Yo back to the Limbo [X2]


It's been about a couple of days gone by 
When I last saw you 
When you said bye-bye 
Then you walked away and left me alone 
All get is a dial tone 
When I call your phone 
Occasionally I'll roll about your way
I thought about the words that I could say 
But you ain't trying to feel me 
You don't even wanna' heal me [BRIDGE #1]
Oh 
Is it my turn to cry over you? 
'Cos no matter what I do 
Those rainy days won't leave me alone [CHORUS]
What kind of love leaves you feeling cold 
All alone with nobody to hold 
Don't wanna' feel like I did that day 
Let the Rain wash the pain away 
Sometimes I think I hear you call my name 
Sometimes it's just my mind playing games 
But nothings changed 
It's still all the same 
Let the Rain wash the pain away 
See your picture all up in a magazine 
With some other cat I've never seen 
You was looking more beautiful then you've ever been 
Here come those lonely feelings again 
I must be tripping on myself 
'Cos the fact that you're with somebody else 
It's getting me down 
Girl, I can't deny 
I guess this is what it sounds like 
When the doves cry [BRIDGE #2]
Oh 
Did you choose girl or do it for him? 
'Cos no matter what I do 
Those rainy days won't leave me alone [CHORUS][break] [CHORUS]


Well I know you heard about girl how I like to
When I do my thing when I'm in the mood

I ain't trying to hide it
Since i laid my eyes on you 
Ain't no use trying to fight it 
From falling deep into you[Chorus]
I want you here with me
It's how it's got to be
Girl ifeel surroundedby you 
Beautiful you are
Just like a shinning star
I want to give my loving to you
Don't you know i'll fall in love
If you were here tonight
And even if i fall apart
I fall apart and you'd be there
So don't you know i'd fall in love
If you were by my side
Ain't no doubt about it 
Cupid's got his eye on you 
Let's make this love a habit
Forever in love with you[Chorus]
Don't you know i'll fall in love 
I'll fall in love if you'll be there
Don't you know i'll fall in love 
If you were here tonight


It's just one of those days when 
Nothing wants to go alright. 
So I slipped on a brand new shirt and stepped out into the night. 
And as I rode down the road in my Benz, 
See you standin' with a man, 
You was chilling with my best friend. 
Acting like he's all you need. 
When last night you was tryin' to get it on with me. [BRIDGE]
You're making your moves on me, baby. 
It's wrong but it feels so right. 
You're trying to play with me, lady. 
But it wont go down tonight... [CHORUS]
You wanna roll with me, roll with me... 
Mess about. 
You better keep it low before we get found out. 
I wanna rock with you, rock with you... 
All night. 
Dance with your body until the morning light. 
You wanna bounce with me, bounce with me... 
Take it slow. 
Don't wanna jeopardize, gotta let you know. 
If you're leaving tonight, it will all be alright. 
Girl, you keep it on a down low. 
You keep on tellin' me nobody has to know. 
But you don't wanna compromise, 
Always keep a brother hooked with your bedroom eyes. 
Gonna do what I can to keep it real 
But inside what I feel, baby girl, what the deal now? 
Even though I always lose, 
Either way that I play but I gotta choose... [BRIDGE]
You're making your moves on me, baby. 
It's wrong but it feels so right. 
You're trying to play with me, lady. 
But it wont go down tonight... [CHORUS]
You wanna roll with me, roll with me... 
Mess about. 
You better keep it low before we get found out. 
I wanna rock with you, rock with you... 
All night. 
Dance with your body until the morning light.

Oh its still a mystery
How she got me high
Anticipating what
She's gonna do cos I
Can't seem to let it go
Addicted by her drug
Aint got no remedy for this contagious kind of love[CHORUS]
Didn't mean to get emotional
Feel like I'm sinking
It wasn't meant unintentional
I can see what you was thinking
Got a hole in her soul
Thats the shape of a man
Tell me who's your next victim
It aint that she hates ya
Its just her nature
Baby dont misunderstand
I give her what she needs
Don't ever seem enough
Aint got no room to breathe
Feels like a tainted love
I need to get away
Seems as though its been
To belong cos when I try
She pulls me right back in[CHORUS x2]
Aint nothing left to give
Just a broken shell
Just enough to live
Just enough to tell a tale[CHORUS]


(Yeah... wooo 
Uh, uh-huh... c'mon... uh 
Yo... ch'mere ... uh, uh)
The first time I laid my eyes on you, 
You know that... girl, you know I had to. 
She had the honeycomb lips fired up.

Girl, you were sent to... 
From up above, Heaven lent you. 
To let me take your time, with the line, what's yer name? 
You telling me you got a man... damn that's a shame ... [BRIDGE]
Somebody let me know,

You know yer messing 'round with my heart 
(The way I'm playing with yer heart, girl...)

Like Sugarbear, don't scandalize mine. 
That's just how I play, get yourself in line. 
Ah, my girlfriends phoning me, uh 
Asking why she found a pair of panties in the backseat, uh. 
Damn! I shoulda known I was wrong to. 
I didn't mean to hurt you girl, I didn't want to. 
But she was too damn, jiggity boom. 
Green eyes, jeans tight, and dark hair... 
I friggin had to. [BRIDGE]
Somebody let me know, 
Why I gotta play all the time in a low-down?

Girl, I gotta let you. 
I need to stop that guy. I'm tryin to get it straight. 
Girl, it ain't no lie. 
My best friend's tellin me to chill now, 
Need to hold it down, 
Baby tell me, ain't you feel now ... [BRIDGE]

[Chorus:]
The Pain Is Gone![Hook: Ab-Soul]
Nah that bitch never leaves
Got me waking up in cold sweats, so I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates but my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live[Ab-Soul:]
A minute ago, I was riding bicycles
And I can buy you Now & Laters with 5 nickels
When it was washing dishes and homework, cable and bullshit
I hit the block and never left
It was exciting watching life bring light to what I'm writing about like
A lamp in a cave, while I'm trapped in this maze
But Frankie Beverly wouldn't walk in my all-stars for a day
I watched kids play and think ignorance is bliss
Then I watched Kid-N-Play on House Party
And wished I was them
See you can say I'm brainwashed
Cause I came from an era where niggas don't care about nothing
And you're judged by how much your J's cost
But me being the rebel I am, I never gave a damn
Leave it to Beaver and the rest of you suckas
I'm complex like the magazine say I'm abstract
Like a trigonometry quiz and science lab rats
If I wasn't odd, you could see the pain in my eyes
I watched brothers kill brothers over system of legal tender
Deteriorating my loins with liquor looking for joy
I put my soul on a platter of joy
I do this for the regular people who out the ink route
Make it popular to be unpopular
Because if we all came together, ain't no stopping us
And it hurts me so, to think how they divided us
Like an island in the road
Just take control if you ain't know
And yo
Lock my body can't trap my mind
I got two decades of experience on my resume
Say I don't qualify and I'll call you a lie
I'm on a whole another plateau, you still tryna be fly
And that goes for the narrow minded who's ancestor was the pharaoh
He went from Number 1 to Zero
Let's Take it back[Chorus:]
The Pain is gone![Punch:]
Nah she still on me
She stalking my innermost thoughts, I guess she want me
Because he primary fear is to die lonely
I got, no disdain for Ms. Pain
She leaves me love letters sealed with a kiss
Lipstick stains on the mirror
She helps me see things a little clearer
Couldn't experience joy if she wasn't near us
I remember throwing shots back til' I collapsed
Waking up hung over in the effort to give her the cold shoulder
It never worked
As soon as I sobered up, I couldn't avoid her tender touch
Like when Izakaya died
I couldn't look his mama in the eyes
Feeling like I contributed to his demise
Guilt stricken, heart victimized
Postpartum Syndrome, I'm blacking out
She's wishing it was me, she cried
Each tear was like a symphony orchestra
Beethoven over the organs, she snapping a tremendous proportion
Take this recording as the truth distorted
Through the eyes of a man who reaped the fruits of her courtship
And no fortune could ever overturn the misfortunes I absorbed in
The pain made me impure like foreskin, more that I can bargain
Fool, still I love her forever more[Chorus:]
The Pain is Gone![Hook: Ab-Soul]
Nah that bitch never leaves
Got me waking up in cold sweats, so I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates, But my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live[Ab-Soul:]
And even when I die, she's going to follow my kids


[Intro:]
Yeah
Uh
One Time 4 Your Mind
Uh
Hah (Yeah)
Let's...
Drift away baby (baby)
Yes
Uh[Verse 1:]
I seen mama make a left on main street
Had to flag her fine ass down off instinct
I'm in the Mitsubishi Mirage in dire need of a car wash indeed
She in the lil' clean Camry
I'm hoping she'll look closer than what she can see
About me, I caught her at a red light
She rolled her window down and greeted me with a smile, Sunny Delight
I'd drink a whole glass of her ass
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
That's what my conscious told me, So I said boldly:
"What's up with you and me?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and the light turned green (green, green, green)[Hook 1:]
No my car ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away[Verse 2:]
I was tryna brush up on a honey at this kickback
Drunk throwing shots back, pretty face, ass fat (ass fat, ass fat, ass fat)
So I got behind that (behind that, behind that)
She didn't mind that
She slow whining, I'm co-signing
I said, "I hope they play Birthday Sex"
She said, "It ain't my birthday yet!"
I said, "I don't give a fuck about that"
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
And then my spoke conscious spoke free
I grabbed my Motorola Razr and said, "Lemme get your math, ma?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and pulled out her 3G
Ahhh[Hook 2:]
No my phone ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away[Verse 3: Not In Music Video]
We had a performance at the club
I'm hype man, I figure I'd get some love
I'm off the orange juice with the Goose
Spotted a hottie on the dance floor getting loose
Approached her like, "You just my type
I had to holler before I hop on the mic"
She said, "Is that so?"
And I said, "Fo sho
I know I got shades on but I can see your glow"
I felt a connection cause baby got close
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
My conscious talked to me and laughed
So I said, "After the show you tryna come to the spot?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and said:
"You know Jay Rock? Oh..."[Hook 3:]
No I ain't that dude!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away[Outro:]
Yeah I know Jay Rock, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we- yeah, yeah I'm his hype man
(Man?) Yeah, I'm his- you know what I'm saying though
Is you know... Uh, uh, yeah, Oh, I...
Have a good night


[Verse 1:]
"Herbert Anthony you need to get you life together"
That's my momma bothered by how I live life like whatever
They say I'm pressed for time, but I don't press the issue
I just stay on my grind, chain smoking marijuan help me free my mind
What a coincidence, like feeling guilt trickin by your innocence
In a sense I'm livin in my second childhood
Don't pay a lick of rent, rhyme, eat, sleep, and shit
And when you twenty-two that don't sound good
Maybe if I went to school it'll be cool
I've have something to fall back on if this rap don't crack
Perhaps I'd have a better story had I sold crack
Let's go back, to Carson high fluctuating my goals
Writing rhymes through the lecture knew I should've took notes
Sometimes I think I'm running in place, chasing hopes
Rejoice my name as Ab-Soul or is it average joe[Hook: x2]
All this commotion goes in one ear, out the other
I'm still gone make it, one way or the other
(Quit acting like a kid herb, gone be a man
It's a man's world, how you suppose to feed your fam
You need to act more like an adult, pull up your pants
I know you do music but what's your plan B man)[Verse 2:]
If I knew when I was younger would I grew to know
I coulda tackle things more different, coulda been more defensive
Coulda been more responsible, coulda been more persistent
But I didn't and I ain't repenting
My parents wake up in the morning to a cup of coffee
Then go off to work it kills'em when I'm still in bed snoring
Only if they knew, their young boy was in the stu
'Til like 5 AM cookin up classics to make them
Proud it's house niggas that could stay in
That was rather rash, but you can replace this scraps with straight cash
I told jay I'm a buy you a house one day
I probably send Katie & [?] to college too
But right now I'm broke as a joke, I should do comedy
Dude, I need a job, somebody hire me fast
So I could win my girl over, she probably cheatin on my ass
You motherfuckers better try and snatch her while she up for grabs[Hook][Verse 3: Ab-Soul talking]
It's like real difficult to articulate it
It's like you got your goals, you got your aspirations
Your dreams, and you chasing that, you pursuing that
But in-turn it cost for you to sacrifice alot of your availability to go out their and get this paper, nah mean?
It's hard to say you a man still and livin at your momma house
Yo, I had a conversation with my step-pops
Basically inquiring the time frame when I'm a pop
I told'em I ain't know but I'm determined to blow
Not like a fluffer, more like plaques that's platinum and gold
That's on my great-grandmother
He shook his head and said:
"I don't know much about the music industry but what's been said
The people ain't making no bread, let's be more realistic
How you gone take care of a wife? how you gone feed your children
I'm on my knees everyday tryna provide for ya'll
I bought that car that you dippin, but you don't chip in
You shouldve went to UCLA, like your cousin Jay
He got a big signing bonus, every year like 80k"
I looked him in the face and said "it ain't about the money
And honestly buying an education sounds funny
But have a little faith in your son, I'll come through for ya"
He said be a man Herb, that's all I really want from ya[Hook]


Do it sound tight?[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Considered a fuck up all of my life
Too smart for my own good all of the time
In kindergarten I got a kick out of pissin' on my classmates
And I recall getting ass whoopings every couple days
I had a Power Ranger bike I wheelied in the street
Got grounded for a month for spray painting it green
I went to middle school and started slacking in my studies
Before the they rise and aimed the gang bangers were my buddies
I wasn't fit for it I needed a tailor
I still went for it
It wasn't out of anger
I needed to be accepted in my neighborhood
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion
I ain't shit
I must be constipating
Cause I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit[Hook:]
Things ain't always what they seem
If you look close you can see
What's your perception of me?
Is it good? I wish it was
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
In ninth grade I started off on the right track
Got a few A's but then I bounced right back
Wasn't aware my main thought was what I should wear
Now that I think about it nobody really cared
I grew up in the church but barely paid attention
Read up on Malcom X and started questioning religion
Became a rebel
I still believe in God
I just doubt the authenticity of Jesus and the Devil
I got my first car and started smoking black and milds
The smell is like a bell and Hades, hella loud
Then it was Newports and Kools on my way to school
My girl hated it but still kissed me in the mouth
I started ditching class more than I attended
I was walking a path that I had not intended
It looked as though I was mad, becoming relentless
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion
I ain't shit
I ain't attracting no flies man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit[Hook:]
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I got kicked out, crept back in
If I wasn't fucking I was fussing with my step-dad again
Oh yeah I rapped, didn't take it that serious
But I flowed like an ocean among my peers
Dreams of going off to college in my younger years
Then the whole thought of it sounded nuts I had dumbo ears
Did about a semester then I was outta there
Said if I get one song on radio, I'm outta here
Knowing that low ratio of successful entertainers
I chose to go at people with skulls, but they was brainless
Started smoking weed as soon as purple kush was famous
Shifting my setting eventually as I went through changes
People I seen my whole life appeared to me as strangers
Created a voice through my music and now they speak my language
I was in Jay Rock video for less than 15 seconds
All of a sudden niggas that I looked up to see me as a legend
Now I step in clubs and some bitches give me hugs
But back in P.E. tennis a nigga got zero love
I'm just a hard headed loser
My mamma was trying to save me from stalling out my future
Cause I ain't shit
I don't need no toilet paper man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit[Hook:]
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit


[Verse 1:]
Game keep changing, Tats on faces
Look close, you can see how rats run races
You find it's all about the cheese at the other end
They forgot the simple shit, like strengthening your limbs
I listen to the radio and I begin to cringe
I eat MCs, find a spot inside my fridge
When y'all was tricking off, taking bitches to the bridge
I was sparking up a cig, tryna tighten up this bridge
The hook is real catchy and the verse is interesting
Now all I need is a feature from Drake or Lil Wayne
I never move hoes, like say a Gucci Mane
I'm broke as a bitch, and I spit like I'm insane
But what a nigga gotta do to shock the whole nation
Sign to ROC nation, become a fucking Mason
Monopolize, prophesize an abomination
I'll Do it, but you thought it was just music?[Hook:]
Passion
What the fuck happened
Somebody talk to him
Motherfuck rapping
(Oooooh, where's your passion)[Verse 2:]
This for my niggas that log on to All HipHop
And listen to niggas they never heard cause they love Hip Hop
I got so much drive I never need a pit stop
It's scarier than a whole hour of Alfred Hitchcock
I'll probably make your bottom lip drop when my shit drop
I'm in tip top condition
With a hustler's ambition
Ounce after ounce, me and Jizzle keep twisting
Until we get twisted like the caps on snitches
Just know our little passion will take you a long way
Like Pussy & Patron can salvage a long day
I dive head first in a verse and swim away
And pull a pen out and throw a grenade at your brigade
Like a Skin Head, you're a barber that can't fade
I'm up all night trying to come up with something crazy
So while you sleeping like a baby
I'm a seal up the deal, no relation to the navy[Hook][Verse 3:]
Uhn
I wake up in the morning and compose a rhyme doper than the last time before I even opened my eyes
Open-minded to the truth, but not naive to what is fiction
I probably love this more than my bitch, say I'm trippin'
Leave your ass in a ditch, if you can dig it
You mad cause I found my niche and you didn't
Too fucking bad
Fuck with Ab
And so you know, every sentence, it is from the Soul[Alori Joh Sings][Ab-Soul randomly talks]


[Hook:]
When the chips are down, the funds are low
And nobody's around to pull you out of this hole
Can you hold your own?
If you ain't got a dollar to your name can you maintain?
Can you hold you own when the going gets tough?
The tough get going[Verse 1:]
Starving artist, rib-cage showing
Give me the loot or give a semi to shoot
Then after, pass the Absolut
I'm trying to hit a lick, probably knock out your tooth
I'm fully equipped with a [?]
Finna get a nigga for every cent if that makes sense
Uh, head shot, you're dead Ock
If feds knock alibi [?] I was on [?] block
You niggas ain't ready for me to get in the mischief
Grimmy with it I hope the motherfucking disk skip
What?! You niggas think you better than me?
Cause you got more cheddar than me? Huh?
You ain't a spitter cause you got a lot of followers on twitter
My body of work would probably embody your Godzilla
I ain't a jerk, I'm an asshole
An I don't wanna hear you rap unless your cash flowing[Hook:]
When the chips are down, the funds are low
And nobody's around to pull you out of this hole
Can you hold your own?
If you ain't got a dollar to your name can you maintain?
Can you hold you own when the going gets tough?
The tough get going[Verse 2:]
Shit, and I'm a mad muthafucka with a loaded clip
Do the math muthafucka!
That's 15 bullets in a nine and one in the chamber, hit you right between the eyes
And even if you live you can't defy the odds
Catch you while you're checking your safe, SUPRISE!
Oh, you thought I was playing with you?
Your man look sleepy so he gon be laying with you
I should've told you muthafuckas straight from the start
Got the flame, if I aim it'll burn you to ashes
Got the blunt rolled all I need is a spark
And watch the paramedic roll up with elastic
Stretcher carry your ass they'll bury you fast
You venereal and a dick head, how bout that?
Blowing more O's than a Cherrio cereal bag
Serial killa for the skrilla; maniac
And like when the camera take a picture I'm finna snap
Your fucking head off your neck then reattach it back
Brainacs get they mind blown
Can't have a migrane when your mind gone[Hook:]
When the chips are down, the funds are low
And nobody's around to pull you out of this hole
Can you hold your own?
If you ain't got a dollar to your name can you maintain?
Can you hold you own when the going gets tough?
The tough get going[Verse 3:]
Down to my last and my ship is sinking fast
I ain't looking for the sympathy, I'm looking for the cash
I ain't looking for my enemey but if he in the way I put the pistol in his mouth
Let him get a taste
Fore you eat say grace, you know I'm coming with the blammer
Not to shoot, just to use it to beat you like a case
What's the root of all evil? A baker said the cake
Gardner said the green, you know what I mean?
I'm sick of digging in my pocket for nickels and dimes
Somethings got to change or I'm resorting to crime
P95 in my palm.45 in my waist
You got a diamond? Run it or nobody's safe
Bill Gates is rich and Ab-Soul is poor
I'll rob his old ass from his head to toe
And as a matter of fact I'm finna blow a bank up
Mindstate of a nigga that went bankrupt!


[Intro:]
This shit right here is like... Heh
This, this shit right here is like the calm before the storm
Like little kids playing in Japan before Hiroshima got bombed on
Yo[Verse 1:]
I'm sick of holding back, Jay told me go harder
How else am I gonna prove I'm the number one author?
Sometimes I wake up in the morning mourning for my father
And the more I think about it - the more I get stronger
It didn't kill me, it contributed to the growth
I take five dollars - contribute it to the smoke
I rather get high while I'm living at the bottom
But even when I ride you gon' see my red eyes
Like the last flight to the night
See I done soared through the air like fighting a knight
I've seen bad times and I cherish the good
My sentences give life, man, fly me a kite if you would
I'm so introspective
All it took was a pen and a little reflection
But what does it to take to be number one?
Will one of you motherfuckers please answer the question
I'm starving out here, and I haven't prayed to God in so long
He'll probably try to charge me for a blessing, am I wrong?[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all[Verse 2:]
I never gave up, niggas want me to raise up
But I'm a kick it 'till my fucking flower bed's made up
Tear a fucking stage up every time we hit a venue
Eating all rappers - Vibe magazine is like a menu
Shall I continue? You said yes didn't you?
Seven star general, all for being liberal
Cause how is it that what I'm saying give you a visual?
I promise all competition candlelight rituals
Quite the individual, deliver the mayhem!
Like swine born in the springtime, I'm borderline psycho
When I come up with lines to bite your
Fucking face off, ya'll ain't trying to face off!
Ab-soul, divine with the rhymes
Bring sight to the deaf and sound to the blind
Ya'll do it for the light intertwined with lime
I do it cause on the mic ain't none of ya'll better
TopDawg, ya'll mice, taking all of ya'll chedddar
Am I right?
Fucking right, yeah[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all[Verse 3:]
Cause 2010 I'm trying to ball nigga
Like shooting jump shots in the mall nigga
Cause my skies are gray
You could say I'm a goose in a pond of some hard liquor
I tend to go overboard with the metaphors
Still walking in the shadow of my team
Jay Rock finna blow - 2010 fo sho
And K-Dot and C4, but what about me?
It's kind of hard to say you top notch
Parking your bucket in front of your mom's spot
Still getting dime bags on credit
Girl wanna go out, all you can afford is iHop
It's fucked up right? That's where I'm at with it
I'm finna crack like a egg hat, stand back[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all[Verse 4:]
And in the midst of the bullshit
I'm still nothing to fool with
The type of nigga bitches wanna get cool with
Primarily cause of my future in music
They seen me shake Nipsey Hussle's hand
I hear them whisper to themselves, "he's the fucking man"
I do one song with Glasses
And I'm the talk in all the high school classes
In the studio with Game
Just soaking up game like I'm standing in the rain
So when I'm in the booth (MAYDAY)
Better yet I'm finna make it my new AKA
Yea, Willie B what up?
Shit's hot sorta like a temperature nigga, keep it up
Uh, and please turn your speakers up
Cause Eric Wright couldn't make it look easier
Rest in peace my nigga
But since you've been gone I've been killing these niggas[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all


[Intro:]
You came in and flicked it
You was flicking it you know what I'm saying
(On fire, on fire, on fire)
I'm trying man...[Verse 1:]
Bitch I'm high as a motherfucking satellite, who got a light?
I'm outta sight, outta mind pimp, matching dimes
Don magic wands, roll the greenery
It's what I need: where my shin and thigh meet
Huh, yeah I'm such a fucking stoner
Everywhere I dwell you can smell the marijuana odor
What the hell? (What the hell?) That's that fire, man
Call the fireman, or the supplier man, tell him slide a gram
(Solo, solo, solo) You know we smoking that dower
Two titans back to back call em Twin Towers
(Haa, Haa) And anytime I'm on the ground
I stop, drop, and roll... then burn it down!
If that's exactly what you're doing right now
Put your lighters up, and wave them round and round
Puff, puff, give: real shit
I'll probably run through seven pounds, Will Smith[Hook:]
Pass the blunt, Pass the blunt
Man you tryna smoke or what?
Four deep in the Hooptie finna roll the windows up
Pass the blunt, pass the blunt
White paper [?]
That was dutch and swishers, even Philly's filling up
Smoke something bitch [x8][Verse 2:]
Black Hippy, sticky in the piece pipe
No I'm no [?] but I'm throwing up the peace sign
Smoke fill the room every time a nigga inside
And when I'm off this I feel like the H.N.I
See no seeds in my product that's a no-no
I'm three dollars short and I'm a need it for the lolo
I owe the weed man down the street, also:
I got the munchies and I haven't ate, Ocho
(Fuego, fuego, fuego) Ab-Solo
I hit the blunt then pass it the horseman on my polo
Daddy Fat Sacks (Smoke something bitch!)
I mean till that motherfucker burn your fingertips
Watch your lip, concentrate
Let's see how much more you can take
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)
And when your bitch call tripping, pimp man this is what you say:
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)[Hook:]
Pass the blunt, Pass the blunt
Man you tryna smoke or what?
Four deep in the Hooptie finna roll the windows up
Pass the blunt, pass the blunt
White paper [?]
That was dutch and swishers, even Philly's filling up[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Got something in that optimal swisher got me feeling right
I'm feeling like, Transformer forming in the highest height (Yesss)
Michael Thriller night, moonwalk in flight (yea, yea)
Heaven or hell, I be good in paradise (uh, uh)
I give you satellite (uh huh)
Or some other shit, Prada Louie printed shits
Getting money growing off the tree, Dough dough
You never smoke but always want the trees, Popo!
And that's a no-no, I get your son
I take his lung, I let you keep the photo
The swisher burning keep me earning everything in slow-mo[?], kick it like a dojo
Wake and bake, elevate
Let's see how much more you can take
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)
And if this month I earn a thou then fuck it I'll buy a vowel
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)
Smoke something bitch [x8][Outro:]
Soul (soul, soul, soul, soul, soul)
(Hahaha) Lil round, tripping


[Hook:]
I've tried to do right
Seems as though the only way is selling my soul
It's getting hard out here
Does anybody feel me?
Cause I'm drowning in shame
Trying to maintain
Wide awake chasing my dreams
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Sometimes I gotta ask myself what do I do it for
Is it to cover up the fact I'm really insecure?
See music made it possible for me to be somebody
So if you had to say yourself
Is my intention pure?
Am I the next Shakur?
Or an intention whore?
Am I big in this prom or am I premature
Does anybody feel me or am I too far to reach
Like the edge of the world, from Redondo beach
Some say I manifest destiny when I'm on these beats
Others say I ain't flashy enough to shine
You need a chain at least
And you can be more hood
You got niggas on both sides
You acting like you ain't good
Well you from Carson right[?] was tight
And you hot
But can you make another soul on ice
Everybody trynna tell me what I shouldn't and should
But will they still wanna [?] it up when I go 'wood[Hook][Verse 2: Punch]
My niggas searching for a pot o' gold
I can [?] to cool my heart to stone
Pumping cement through my veins
Taking everything for granted
Who can recognise my pain
Y'all niggas never did hear me
So I quit calling out to niggas
Let y'all deal with it, I figured
Why cast my pearls to swine
If you don't know about grapes
I couldn't tell you 'bout wine
I couldn't tell you 'bout these lines
They just hit me like rain
Without a cloud in the sky
On a summer's day
Ay, I guess it's how I was raised
Accurate knowledge, while my peers frolicked and played
My product was in some ways, disrupting my coming of age
Future looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
I'd never cover my face
I look death in the eyes, didn't blink one time
I never felt more alive than that day
But who's to say I'm different
And when I speak niggas scared they ain't listening
And that's beyond me
But I believe just four more minutes
And the truth was stranger than fiction once reality get to kicking in
It's like the modern day Noah's Ark, they took no note
Their bare heart came back and bit them no their hope floating
That's why I'm fishing through a sea of niggas
They don't hear me and I don't see 'em niggas[Hook][Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
You see, it's like the Titanic scene
With the rescue boats
Slash dramatic in that
I can save y'all with quotes
I dropped the gym adrenaline accelerated my pulse
And I can say it's dope but what do I really know
Currently the word is that I'm too abstract
I can barely get my engineer to mix my tracks
I'm trynna provide you with facts
Trynna keep it real
But y'all not interested in that
You're more concerned with my appeal
You rather see me on youtube, unconcealing and still
Or on WorldstarHipHop, with diamonds in my wristwatch
Or a media take-out
Victim of a media stakeout
Cursing them out so bad
Most of my words were blanked out
I hate it when my name is mentioned with the same niggas
Who other than their DNA are the same niggas
They in the same circle, fuck the same bitches
Shake the same hands, man I'm trynna expand
For me it's gotta be to catch a flight back to Carson
I'm a need a passport for it
If you don't wanna hear me do your boy a favour
And press fast-forward, and listen to the emotion in the chorus
No this ain't a [?] outfit
But if it was I wore it
Come from a different cloth, rippin my bars
Pause
With my bare hands I can move the earth
Just cause I said it in my verse
That's the power of words
You may not ever get what I was trying to accomplish
I might not ever get to do a song with Jay
And hear him brag on Hot97 about how I'm so [?]
I'm ready to throw in the towel like laundry day
But I feel as though I've reached the point of no return
Like an expired thirty day warranty
And I deserve to be the best artist you heard
And I put that on, [?]
That's my word


[Verse 1:]
You mighta caught me walkin on annalee
On my way to work, I ain't no jerk, you can wave at me
Faithfully I strafe from all the make-believe, pray for me
This the shit they make-up make me think maybe it's maybelline
They will not disable me, even Kane afraid of me
Now niggas wanna network like A&E
City on my back like a superman cape would be
Ab-soul, asshole, why you act an ass for?
You ain't even got your own pad you a tadpole
It's a future ahead of you, why you looking back though
Frontin like you in the front when you in the last row
Microphone check 1, 2 are you hearin this
Curtiss king will tell you I'm a lyricist, lyricist
Been a trip before I caught a flight, alright?
Why you think I'm always smiling, I'm nice
Rapper's delight, that titles suffice
I don't even think you existed but my idol is christ
I too have a passion for what I feel is right
That's why I get high as a Wright brother and write[Hook:]
Cause I just need'em to remember me
Before I'm dead and gone write my name in history
Mentally, I'm meant to be, infinite, energy
Martin Luther King of carson, peace to my enemies
And cause this is Long Term 2
And every one of my dreams will all come true
This a journey we all go through
And if you can't cut it then it's all on you[Verse 2:]
I had to be about two
All I remember was Charlie Brown and Dr. Seuss
Momma read me a bed-time story every night
Comprehended so well I thought it was all true
That's all truth, 20 years later
I became a wordsmith like a kid from will and jada
Took a fifth of henny to the head and thought ahead
Why they worrying bout my buzz, I ain't a insect
What the fuck, ya'll got me fucked up
(What the fuck, ya'll got me fucked up)
Don't get a nigga mis-conscrewed
Cause I get loaded like a brand new pistol, ahhh shoot
Long as you knew that I'm on the pursuit
Of greatness 'til I lay in a tomb, I'm raiding
The game is weak, knowing it's painful and not short
However long it take just know I'm not going[Hook][Verse 3:]
(Heaven ain't far Soul)
Yea, I swear to God I wrote this on annalee
On my way to work, I'm late, I know my momma mad at me
(PEACE) to all the homies formerly know as casualties
Prosect, I miss you man I do this shit for you
I revise my timelines see how I do
2000 I was cool, '01 I had fun
'02 I recorded my first song and I was sprung
'03 I was weak, '04 I had flow
'05 I signed a street beef with no dough
'06 I met punchline, Damn I thank punchline
He saw more in my music than metaphors and punchline
'07 DudeDawg told me I was family
In '08 you became a fan of me
'09 I went around the country in a rock band
Now it's twenty-ten ya'll, get a catscan dawg[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
It's Mr Ab Soulutely
More drive than the fastest hooptie
More alive than a newborn unicorn in the sky
And I just get more fly by the second I wreck it
That immortality is not a myth or just a lie
'Cause every time I speak this thesis is justified
Sublime rhyme and reason being why
I am I sayonara if you can't keep up for the ride[Hook:]
Just for my
Just for my
Just for my (open up)
Real Thinkers (Open Up)
Real Thinkers (Open up)
And touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Real thinkers (open up)
Real thinkers (open up)
You thirsty?
Open Up Your Mind[Bridge: x4]
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't[Verse 2:]
Understand exactly what it takes to be creative
And display greatness the dedication it takes
The time consumption the stakes if you say it ain't high
That's a blind assumption and open your eyes or something
Defy the odds
Multiply with nothing grip the skies
I open minds in hopes that you open your mind
Holding my fro and scoping the scene out
And spitting sixteens spitting my spleen out
Thought I had it made but ain't shit clean
And I been chasing this dream since Wayne made Bling Bling
I drift off in thought and teleport to Beijing
Pushing 25 but still feelin like 18
With more insight than a encyclopedia
The Carson Arson warm enough to fight anemia
And I'm just warning up
Got em sweating bullets big enough to load the pump[Hook:]
Just for my
Just for my
Just for my (open up)
Real Thinkers (Open Up)
Real Thinkers (Open up)
Real Thinkers (Open Up)
You can touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Real thinkers (open up)
Real thinkers (open up)
Open Up Your Mind[Bridge: x4]
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't[Verse 3:]
Strategize, just fantasize
They don't emulate they just antagonize
They don't illustrate they just be writing rhymes
They don't demonstrate they hide behind their lines
And on my rise to success
I'm just searching for the perfect concept
I swear I'll be the Einstein of my time
It's not E but AB equals MC squared
LONG TERM MENTALITY


[Verse 1:]
I feel like, I'm affiliated with, the illuminati, bitch
All seein' fuckin eye (I), this is your enlightenment
I'm lightin' this, fire my supplier always like to give
Higher than I've ever been these heights are mighty frightening
Throw ya hands up as if you wanna strike like lightening
Don't shoot, you can't fight a viking on vicodin
Can you? Hmmmm I would like to see you try it then
I be eatin' rappers that's the only way I'm bitin' them
That was yummy yummy, dummy dummy, nothing's funny funny
Give a bitch a sippy sippy, then I get some sucky sucky
Sucky sucky now, think the nigga must be lucky lucky
She's such a doll, I guess that makes me Chucky
Wassup with ya'll other than nothing at all?
Bitches lickin' my balls, you ain't nuttin' at all!
You ain't nuttin' at all
Neither am I
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O[Chorus:]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Fly nigga, fly nigga
Party every single night
Mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone
Die nigga, die nigga[Verse 2:]
Life's a bitch, but she won't let me hit
So I just masturbate to her naked flicks
I ain't got change for a dolla, but I think I'm making sense
I do resemble my father, but do I really know I'm his?
Sometimes I like to go on a tangent of random shit
Stay with her Black n Mild out with a handful of acid tips
Skywalker in the blunt, Darth Vader in the cup
You don't get lifted with us, your elevators stuck
I never gave a fuck, my name never came up
But now that I done came up, I think I'm King Tut
I told Punch I'd probably get assassinated by the government
He probably think I'm sniffin' cocaine and some other shit
I'm on some other shit, Black Hippie ho!
Yippy ka yeee, Yippy ka yoo
Tilt ya head you see me in the sky
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O[Chorus:]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Fly nigga, fly nigga
Party every single night
Mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone
Die nigga, die nigga[Verse 3:]
Drownin' in Moscato, popular pothead
Feel like I hit the lotto, and I just got head
From a famous model (who?), Gloria Velez
Lusting for Cubana's culo you know what it is
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, experience my fate
All I'm missin' is a band of gypsies and some purple haze
But now it's OG Kush and aeroinstrumentals
No need to insinuate, miss me with the innuendo
Ya outlooks lousy someone needs a new window
I'm a win I just don't know when though you bimbos know what you in for some info to make you exercise your mental
A seed small as my pinkie can be your weeping willow
I'm so I'll I'm held hostage at a hospital
Doin' it big like not little
Tivo the revolution when it's televised
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O[Chorus:]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Fly nigga, fly nigga
Party every single night
Mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone
Die nigga, die nigga


[Intro:]
Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, Gimme mine
Uh, gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, bitch gimme mine
Gimme mine, nigga gimme mine
Gimme mine, gimme mine
But I...[Hook:]
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Let me get it back from the top Ali[Verse 1:]
Life
I wonder will it take me underground like a runaway slave
Where the hip hop radio don't play, what more can I say
I need to get away from the lights...
Flashing in my face like a topless model
And the topless bottles keep popping like a Glock
And it's coming non-stop, take a shot - don't worry about the price
Everything is paid for, you fully accommodated
When you bumping shoulders with the Grammy nominated
Making American Pie, get you a slice
It's the American Dream, right?
So it seems I need to air out my self-esteem
It's so high
But I...[Hook:]
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lying
(I may just) need to
(Go on a hiatus) Yeahhh[Verse 2:]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Better yet I did, I should bury me
And I ain't even sell one record yet
And she can see I'm hanging on barely
And my bitch say I'm arrogant
Cause when she with me I feel she should cherish it
Only cause you never know when I'm a perish
Not the clothing line but if the shit fit I wear it
Stick to the script I will - Ferris
Nobody ever said it'll be fair so
When the tabloids read "Death To Ab-Soul"
I couldn't get up, said I'll keep it on the down low
You never know what's next, or know what to expect
Still wanted for [?], but now I'm a prospect
From dusk until dawn, I feel like a object
Under a telescope
But I...[Hook:]
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lying
(I may just) need to
(Go on a hiatus) Yeahhh[Bridge:]
I loosen my tie
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)[Intro plays until end of song]
I need a Mai Tai
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Hello, good morning
This is mourning, just a feeling I reckon
I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it
I heard I got fans and friends playing my records
I'll visit as soon as I can, you can bet it
Don't forget that dash in my name when you print it
It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice
Niggas looking real meek soon as we step in it
I'm a God MC not a polytheist
And why is your reaction always so obvious
Let a reverend run in my adidas
You'll see that despite all these dislikes I am like Jesus
Don't follow 10 commandments
But I don't seem to break to many of them either
Try to understand me
Obama said "yes we can"
But that can't be
Cause we was raising money for his campaign
T-shirt, plates, and mugs
But won't do the same in our own community?
What the fuck...
I said what the fuck?[Hook: Ab-Soul]
And it ain't nothing new
All I do is eat, sleep, and shit
Reflect on my life
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
How's it going, good afternoon
I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you
It's funny though, I could have just told a lie
And made it true to take the mood
You think I am what I ain't
Like a saint or fake
We could go toe to toe, you're choice it's no debate
Soul brother number 2
And every single one of my dreams is coming true
I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
But it always ends up with me running out of tree
In sheer disbelief
Tell me how I can get high as the sky and keep my ear to the streets
At the same time, no diamonds in my watch
Can I still shine, will anybody watch
If I could hold you attention for at least a minute
You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist
Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace
And obviously ominous to your opinions
Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion
Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission
I don't mean to disrespect when I express
My vision was meant to connect not to reject
Don't press eject...
I said don't press eject...
Soul![Hook: Ab-Soul]
And it ain't nothing new
All I do is eat, sleep, and shit
Reflect on my life
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
It ain't nothing new to me
Should be nothing new to you
Let's accomplish the impossible
Free in body, mind, and soul[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
No idea's original
It's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do
But how it's done
If you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means your inferior not major...


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Soulo back up in this ho
Man I hope the magnum fit
Soulo back up in this ho
Man that pussy magnifique

Soulo back up in this ho
Man I hope the magnum fit
Soulo back up in this ho
I hope she don't tell my bitch
God damn I'm so ignorant
At the same time so brilliant
Cuttin up, cesarean

Hell yea I know they trynna rewrite the constitution

Hell yeah I'm bout that, you can't tell my nig?
Long term I got a legacy to leave my kids

(You got, you got some more moscato?)[Ab Soul:]
Yeah

We all know opposite attract
Like a rail road
And I like
You to do anything you please
When you're with me
Mama
Let's head home
And crack a bottle of the Sutter's Home
And hit some trees, Why not?
Where your head at
Hope it's in the gutter like mine
Not where you find rats
Talkin' about where you find ecstasy
Come have a lil bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the mornin'
Till the sun has fallin'
Like a new born
Baby you stallin'
You know you want all this
Long dick
Oh shit
Might want to make you my misses
Like I lost it
Peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room
Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb (What?)
Peek-at-chu
Let's pop this cork
Let me rub on your neck
Till your Victoria's secret get all wet
And your Victoria's secret safe with me
Let me Victoria's secret leave your legs[Bridge:]
I know you had a hard day baby
Relax your mind
Shit
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
Everything was fine[Hook:]
When things get hard to swallow
We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
Ya love it
We can even do it tomorrow
Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo (mm hum yeah, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the moment for your lovin' (But now we on somthin' new)
You love it[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh
Guess whose back in this mother fucker
Lookin' like a mother fuckin' chi-town pimp
Alright
Make my money flip
Make my money flip
Make my money flip
I'll be in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
With an AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk
Make everybody scream
Put the missing punk
On everybody's screen
Ain't nothin' changed bout the ends I'm holdin'
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed
But a nigga be rollin' with a bad bitch
And the bitch be rollin'
Dolphin pills and moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessey on the bartender bill
Just a good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight
And fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight
Plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite
With a 5-Star freak
Slingin' that dick while baby eat
On her punani
Ooo mommys
Look at yours bodies
I'm geeked
Havin' a good time
Put my
Peen
In a muther fuckin
Bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga don't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)[Bridge:]
I know you had a hard day baby
Relax your mind
Shit
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
Everything was fine[Hook]
When things get hard to swallow
We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
Ya love it
We can even do it tomorrow
Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
You love it[Ab Soul:]
Uh
I said
It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
With a glass of moscato
What up ho, what up
I said
What up ho, what up
I said
It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
With a glass of moscato
What up ho, what up
I said
What up ho, what up
Alright
Sip slow
Relaxation
That's are motto
Soul


You would have thought I was infatuated with being underrated instead of renowned
Got me feeling like King David before the crown
I too have my views like you
Look what I do to stand on stages in front of crowds
I need food but I'd rather smoke a Black & Mild
Get back in the booth and spill my heart until I bust a valve
And that's the truth, hand over my left titty
I had faith in hip hop before she met Biggie
Just take this shit a day at a time
I thought I was on after Day In The Life
But you know our shit get put on hold after reality strikes
You ain't know [?]
How you eat when there ain't even a bowl?
My stomach sound like something in the jungle
My mind saying give it up, the people saying don't go
It's easier to leave when you ain't got no dough
Cheap champagne wishes and thirty ratchet hoes
All up in my videos until you niggas see the vision (I ain't playing)
Guess a nigga never checked out the tension
In my second childhood making music from the soul
Just so you know, cracker back [?]
On and on and on and
They think me and these other rappers have something in common
God bless them, all men
I ain't stressing, I'm all in
They in Lois Lane, I'm Clark Kent
Go back to what's happening
Jay Rock finna drop and walk you all around [?]
Kendrick keep getting chased by cameramen
And for the first time you've seen a Hoover Crip on the charts
As for me I'm still an amateur, venting
Looking for the right cannon
To capture your attention, I need honorable mention
Most of all I need to exist in the fourth dimension
But niggas say I sing better than I rap
Who give a crap about all them damn metaphors and diction? (fuck that)
Took a step back to reevaluate my steez
Went to friendzone alone and wrote a gang of trees
Labels calling for everybody except for me
Like I ain't got the recipe
Like this ain't my destiny
You know how much my family expect from me?
Especially considering I'm literally chasing a dream
Told G-packs I'm a slip through the crack
Get that cream, that's a fact yo
Whoever thought I'd get to write for Dr. Dre?
He probably thought it was trash and threw that shit away
But it's a new day, new possibilities
My time'll come sooner enough
No hostility, that type of shit'll slow you up
Don't get caught up in all of the marketing to show you up
He from Top Dawg?, he more like a pup
He ain't from the streets, where the fuck he come from?
Who cosigning [?], don't believe the hype
You niggas can't see me, can't call me on Skype
I'm all bite, no bark
A Benz to a Go-kart
All I do is go as hard as adult film costars
So on and so on
Never lag, never that
You can't see?, look
They told me to break a leg, so now I'm an amputee
Give me fifty feet like G-unit's sneaks
Soul brother number two times whoever you bring
Motherfucker
T.D.U.D


[Intro]
Fucking wisdom tooth hurt
Awww maaaan [laughs][Female Voice] "Time flies when you're having fun"[Verse 1]
I can't even let it breath
I ain't got a second to spare
But I'm definitely hair, like fur
Do you concur?
I'm only the seed of Herbert the Third
And the creature conceived in Korea
Word
More of a reason to be a overseer
Four years older than Helina, man we're getting old
In four years your be a senior, at least I hope
And hope is all a nigga got
You put your all in something, then that's all you've got
So why would that lollygag
Popping four fives, pop a tag
There's more to life
I know my wrongs, I know my rights
And while you jog, I travel at the speed of light
I see the light, shades on
You got an Audemars with diamonds in the face, huh[Hook]
Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Question, how many milliseconds in a year?
31,558,468,000 and yeah, I googled it
But which one of you would have counted?
I thought it was astounding
My biggest fear is blinking and missing a whole year and thinking I was tripping
Now that's a disappearing act for your ass
Wesley and Sanaa didn't have it that bad
My mind travel so fast that I can see the future today
Trying to escape like a fugitive in 2088, play it safe
Preparate, you still trying to segregate
You better be trying to get your ticket on them arks they about to make
Know or be amazed, you caught in a maze
You need your hair done, you need the brand new Js
You need your nails done and you need 28s
So you can skate on them hoes, fuck if they say no, there's plenty more[Hook]
Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested[Female Voice] "Time Flies when your having fun"
Time [x3][Verse 3: Punch]
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of time
I'm Francis Ford Coppola
The writer of Apocalypse Now is upon us
I guess time is the opponent
With Armageddon approaching, I'm striving to be the dopest
Instead of getting prepared, I'm focused on hypnosis
With the flow, yeah I know how close it is
I'd rather match with Soul about who the coldest is
And carry on like I don't notice this
Sprinkle jewels here and there while committing the grossest sins
Infinite living just isn't consistent with our comprehension
Everything we know has an ending
Analyze time, it means limits, I never knew them
I'm throwing shots back, the world spinning
4026 before our common era man was made
In 2012 we live in terror
Cause time is of the essence
We ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Yeah, said Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
I hope my intellect is manifested
There's so much more I want to say but there's just not enough time
Time [x4]


You know it feel like that though[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yes you were designed to fail
No you will never attain, everything
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look away
Don't take responsibility for your actions anyway
In anyway, shape form of fashion
Don't be rational for goodness sake, a-dapt
There's no need to stand up, act like you got bad back
Spasms that you can't take
You are not invincible, imbecile you can break
I pity you, pitiful and I hope you go to hell
Even if the pit is full
Let's make that a mandate
I hope you hate what I did to you, did I get to you?[Hook: Alori joh]
Everybody, wants to, be victorious
We can make this (world) more of a euphoria[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yes you were designed to fail
No you will never attain, everything
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look away
Think of all the bad decisions you made
In the past even to this day
Drive yourself mad, run out of gas on the information interstate
That might be a bit much if it is in my intents to offend ya
And leave dents in your confidence
Blow your fuse, sabotage your views
So you can keep a funky attitude, like the parliament
And everyday I do, that's why you never grew[Hook][Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
No you weren't designed to fail
Yes you where meant to attain, everything
What a magnificent brain
Such benevolent ways, look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look her straight
In the face, come to grips with who you are and
Who you ain't
Where you going, where you been
Help your family, help your friends
Plant a seed, teach, he or she to be the, deity
The media will never perceive us
As, get your five dolla' ass up
Make change, make a way for today
Tomorrow was yesterday
Find a fine line between time and space
Contact the cosmos and you'll hear em say[Hook][Outro: Ab-Soul]
The vail is being raised
For many, we are living in the last days
For us, it's only the beginning
One love, one conscious, one kinetic mind
Hiii Power!


[Intro]
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
If you ain't got a dollar to your name
Can you maintain?
Are you lost, are all your thoughts
On the same train?
I been ridin it, doubt
Despite the amount
I've yet to acquire
In my checking account
They checkin me out
They peepin my game
I paid my dues
I even kept my receipt and my change
My life is like a movie
If Siskel hate it then sue me
Fuck a Maybach, I'm straight in the back of this hooptie
It started out a hobby, became my life
Left my emotions, lonesome, hence the pain I write
Some call it therapy
Some call it rap music
I call it hip-hop
No, no
No trap music
You never seen me heat the pot
To whip the rock
You never seen me creepin down your block
With the Glock
You never seen no diamonds in my chain
Or in my watch
You never seen me in a G5
Or on a yacht
But picture that[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Picture this
Picture being poor
Picture being rich
Picture having more
Picture not having shit
Picture that
What a sight to see
Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we
Together at the top
Where we should be[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Speaking of being at the top (Champagne, bottoms up)
I take that back, cause matter of fact
This E and J
Dollar shot
Is hittin the spot
Like a rave
My real niggas give me props
Cause I ain't afraid to say
What I am and what I am not
You had her not
I had like seven dollars knowin I'mma drop five
On that session
As soon as A-chizzle hit the block
Chocolate swisher burn slow
Though I hope it never stop
So I can get high
And accomplish my endeavors
Niggas pullin up in benzes, tellin me that I'm the one
I'm guessin when my clock climaxes then my time'll come
I never shot a gun
But I be killin all y'all raps
Cause all y'all wack
I be joggin on all y'all tracks
I mean so many lines that
I could call you all back, yeah
I could send you all a fax, with all facts
Budget tighter than my bitch's all black bra strap
Grab a digital camera
And
Picture that[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Picture this
Picture being poor
Picture being rich
Picture having more
Picture not having shit
Picture that
What a sight to see
Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we
Together at the top
Where we should be[Interlude]
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
In the presence of my gifted ass
Incredible gift of gab
Don't have a cent to spare
But pull up a chair, I'll take you back
To where my Christmases was full of gifts
I surely had
Left Santa milk and cookies
(We miss you Bernie Mac)
Left him a letter
And what do you know, he even wrote my back
I don't remember what it said
But the point is that
Soon as I had to take the role for my own acts
It seemed as though, all my presents started gradually turnin into coal
I graduated with a car
Four years later that motherfucker's stuck in park
I missed the days we cut through the alley to the limo park
Or further than that
Nick at Nite, Are you Afraid of the Dark?
I keep these memories on my mind
Cause they define me like Dictionary.com
Bliss kisses ignorance
Pay them unless
Your intelligent
And her pussy be wet as shit
You would come in a flash
Please hold the flash
But picture that[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Picture this
Picture being poor
Picture being rich
Picture having more
Picture not having shit
Picture that
What a sight to see
Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we
Together at the top
Where we should be[Javonte]
Photogenic I are
No need to be camera shy
Hand on the bible, I ain't tellin a lie
We only got one, so I'm livin my life
Photogenic I are
No need to be camera shy
Remember where I been, where I'm going
And I only got one, so I'm livin my life


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Before I exit out this motherfucker, bet you know my name
I'm into Swisher Sweets and five dollar champagne
You should join my campaign before I lose my damn brain
I'm chasing a winning and I don't know if I'm losing or winning
Damn shame
Shit, I ain't complaining
It's no limits nigga, it's only entertainment
So I'm in the Bugatti and got the burner too
Right place, right time, I'll murder you
Huh, I finally get it
What's the use in being witty ain't nobody wit' it
I'd rather sticky my woody in a wonder woman
So good I might never want another one
But I'mma always want another woman
Real nigga to the core my dude
Straight from the liquor store
From getting more sippy from me and my recipients
Till we stumble to the floor my dude, straight off top
T.D.E. till 3003
No scratch that, I can't calculate that exact
My downfall will probably never be an incident though
Use your mind, don't just listen to the instrumental
Read the signs before you end up in a pile of shit
You probably did
The least you can do is crack a window
You smell that?
And if I catch him taking a nap, I tell him that...[Hook]
I hope it hit you like a bus done run up into ya
I'm only fuckin' with ya
I know it's nothing to ya
What I gotta make is something to ya
Slept on us long enough, you got it coming to ya[Verse 2: MURS]
See me I'm from the mid, don't fuck with the kid
Heavy artillery, this long will split your wig
Put your fitted on the curb
You know, rip your lid
Brains on the sidewalks you know what it is, that is
I got that strict mentality
Razorblade in my mouth, Bitch wanna battle me
Huh? I slice this bitch up, I ain't playin
Snare need stitches from the words that I'm sayin'
Name my badem, Reppin' L.A.'n
Tattoo's showin', mean muggin' at the way in
Smack you with a bottle that I picked up on the way in
And them niggas that rollin' with you only with you cause you pay 'em
And real niggas don't get extorted
We call for the mother ship, then we board it
That mean we fly like we wanna fly
Me and Ab comin' for you, better go runnin' high[Hook][Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Look, I'm really sick, you need to quit
Like quiet without the E
Supplyin' the D-man's
Sometimes it gets deep man
You will die in the deep end
Surviving to see it
And I'mma be here, The bible is re-writ
HiiiPower, you can yell it
But make sure it's three it's when you spell it
I'm at the bottom of the barrel, let them niggas tell it
I might have to put the barrel to a niggas melon
Pull up on a few hoes in the new McLaren
Back to the condo, condom broke, now I'm a parent
Still smilin' in the mirror, nigga here to think
Everybody got it comin' to 'em, even me
You only reap what you sow
You only get what you knit
My garden's grown, and I'm about to throw a fit


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares
About the hard work you put in but who said life was fair?
It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet
And boil it in the pot make it hard to eat
I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps
Raise stakes, take stage, speak my peace
Make my pay, take my lady on a date
Send my parents on a cruise - living
Somewhere with a killer view
Oh the irony I spew
But for now the studio couches gonna have to do
I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself
Foolish pride
That's what you need to survive
It's do or die
So step aside I don't mean no trouble
Just want to be someone that CJ could look up to
Oh, and just so you know
When I'm on the road I'm at the travel lodge not the W[Hook: Ab-Soul & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Almost there, almost there, almost there
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there
Almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there, almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine
Almost[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Somebody asked me, what you mean by longterm mentality, actually?
So I had to break it down:
Don't get caught up in the now
Focus on the years abroad
Cause today you're here but tomorrow you could be gone
Singing the same old song
And who's the place to blame on?
Other than you
Whatever it is you do
From slanging eight balls to graduating from school
Just gotta see it all before it happens
I ain't saying see a psychic I'm just saying have a
Idea of what you're accomplishing
You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it
You know a little strategy, premeditation
Wins races nine times out of ten
As if losing's ever an option
Had to bust my own bubble I really thought I was poppin'
(Not quite)[Hook][Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Just know your future's right around the corner
Opportunity galore for ya
More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be
In any event, eventually
Treat your first like your last time
Cause it might be your last time
That's what I learned last time
Look forward to looking forward in my pastime
You just letting time pass like "that's fine", as wine
Contrary to popular belief, I want the peace
They say I'm headed hellbound at God's speed
Gazunteight, or bless me if you like
As I, put my faith in this bud and budlight
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Talk my shit, drop my load on
Hold on, I don't think you know how close I am
By the time this song's done I'm already there


[Intro: Angela McClosky]
I brought you something close to me
And left with something new
See through your head
You haunt my dreams
Nothing to do but believe
Just believe[Verse: Ab-Soul]
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
Long Term Mentality, still remember them cheap wood benches
How could I ever forget, I never could get
How niggas couldn't get up and get all they could get
Man I done seen a thing or two of things that she or he will do
To fit in with each other nitpicking at each other
Killing each other, bringing each other down
Crustations in a bucket, fuck it
Roll your windows down in your bucket, play this loud
Soul brother number fucking two
My time on these 1's and 2's
I'm on this track like running shoes
I dedicate this one to Cletus Anderson for working harder than the average man
Or bend over backwards for his family
Doing whatever is you ask for him
Shit, I know he fucking tired
He should be somewhere retired
Still trying, bills still due
And between me and you until we get a mill
Life smells like mildew[Hook: Ab-Soul and Pat Brown]
Long term (This is long term!)
Long term (I'll help you suckas, cause I take it long term)
Long term (I came, I saw, and conquered)
Mentality, mentality, long term (And it's an honor)
Long term (To share this with you, wait no longer)
Long term (Mother fucker this is long term)
Mentality, mentality, long term


[Intro: Ab-Soul]
As we proceed to give you what you need, T-D-E[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q & Ab-Soul]
Omega, Black Hippy came through to switch flavors
Wake and bake no taters
Pa-pass me the ketchup I'll homestyle fry em'
You niggas better catch up as swift as I am
I was born in Zion
I defeated the Lion, soul made of iron
Yeah, Soul made of iron
Now a nigga talking, now you can't fold when you trying
Try for triumph
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying
Dying! Fuck the world missionary, Malcom got popped
Obama got in office, and I'm still on the block
Ain't shit changed,the grinding never stops
Call it progress, and the reason why the chicks always fall in our nest
Two niggas getting high
Heh! Flying objects. Hehehaha! Yes!
We got next, now forever the hippy is black interrogated by (By!)
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maze together and blaze
Don't be afraid, (Aye), See this is how we do
Would say I thought you knew but that would not be true
In fact, Be Q
You fags are through and like all of you teachers thus far
I'm passing you (Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh)[Hook: Ab-Soul & Schoolboy Q]
Black Hippy! Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy
Soul!
Black Hippy, Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy
(yeh) Black-bla-b-b-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-b-b-Black Hippy
Please fix ya face, we rolling up so much, anticipation
We finna shock the nation, Oh Shit! Constipation!
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches fuck hoes
Fuck bitches (We finna shock the nation) fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, (Constipation)fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes (As we proceed)[Verse 2: Jay-Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Activist
(black hippy) Rebel without a cause
Full clip left you stiff like a manikin
Hit him in his temple, left him at the Taj Mahal, What you on
I'm on some other shit, feeling like I stepped off the mother ship
We sabotage the government, CIA gotta evacuate when we done
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run
It's going down I said
Boogie down, down
Boogie down Bronx
In a black borrow hound
Bumping Biggie like
Pac ain't dead
Two side call it Twenty-two (Ugh)
I'm twenty-two and I rap like twenty zoos
Straight animal
Ace Ventura couldn't find no cure
So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
Protein shakes, acid, and manure[Hook]


[Intro:]
This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy as much as I do
Are we ready? I am, because it's all about control
And I've got lots of it[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Soulo ho, the one and only
You niggas know me, your bitches want me
Determination, I got a grip, 9-5 locs I am not a Crip
Blood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers
Your short term tall tales won't sell here
And Ms. Aiko told me let my soul sail here
Let me get a 'hell yeah'
Open your eyes
You niggas know what it is
It's about that time
Soulo ho?
You niggas know what it is
It's been a hell of a ride
You niggas know what it is
We live one hell of a life
So Soulo ho?[Verse 2:]
Manipulating minds, reciprocating times
Split on my
Said I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon
We can see you half-stepping, I should somersault
Some are salty that I made it in the way I did
Cause I really did everything I say I did
Let me tell you why I'm vexed
The same reason why I'm stressed, the same reason why I'm blessed
I stopped playing, and I started planning
I stopped playing, and I made it happen
We mapped it out, and now the map is ours
Raised my stats off of records, check an almanac
Thank God punchline knew I had a knack
Down two die to get my point across like craps
Control System, cut off your radios, cut off your television


[Intro:]
B-O, what up my nigga?
E3 I'm a get you on these backwoods last thing I do nigga
Yeah
Oh shit nigga! Oh shit nigga!
These niggas done did it again
Tae Beast why you do that man?
Why the fuck you had to do that man?
This shit sound like a 100 birds under the Carson Sheriff Station
I told Rizac I get off my stash
We really out here my nigga![Verse 1:]
When I roll through the city it give me a rush
Yeah I'm high off life but I'm rolling blunts
And they couldn't wait for Soul to reappear
Click, boom. T.N.T., TDE, we in here
Mm, mm, mm! I can smell fear
From a mile away, you might as well get from round here
I run the town like Roc Nation, no exaggeration
Bet I rise like Lazarus, use your imagination
Fascinated by you faggots hating
Get an occupation
You in violation, provoke annihilation
Flow like the Nile river, yo it's now or never
You had a release date, but now it's never
Yeah, welcome to the Control System
I'm stimulating the hoes and educating my niggas
I wiggle through potholes, my destination is vivid
To the end of the road I'm driven
Y'all trippin'
Soulo[Hook:]
And we stunting like
Ab-Soul, abstract, asshole
Give the people what they need
Damn right, let 'em know
You got some kind of disease
I'm the illest in the business
If you ain't with the business, mind your business
And we stunting like
Ab-Soul, abstract, asshole
Give the people what they need
Damn right, let 'em know
You got some kind of disease
I'm the illest in the business
If you ain't with the business, mind your business
And we stunting like[Verse 2:]
Like I ain't never had shit
Cause I never had shit
Same Chucks, two years straight, doing bad shit
Sick, twist two spliffs out my dime bag shit
Pissed, tryna get a good response out this bad bitch
Which one of you niggas wanna call my bluff?
Wish granted, call his ass granite, now he mopped up
Never been locked up but I keep a sentence
Winners win and sinners sin only to ask God forgiveness
In this world of luxury cars, illegal tender
Johnny want me like Wyclef Jean gone til' November
Pop my collar like I'm Don Juan, green to my slippers
Just remember that they don't want me to get ignorant
Sinister literature, given from this wicked minister
Witness your future diminish
No present from Saint Nicholas in particular
You're just a thing of the past
I'm a diamond ring in the trash
No reason to brag, it's Ab[Hook][Verse 3:]
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Can't lose, you niggas must admire defeat
You lying like Nala nigga, you know where to find a nigga
Del Amo, Carson in the house
The View, The Village, Scottsdale and right back around
Can't forget about The Patch, matter fact
I got some homies off Grace Ave., we go way back
Been running round since L train cut up at our people
Rocket was my role model, Lil' Rocket my number one O-migo
With fifteen in the back alley
Hop fences and skip school
Fellowship with the gang members, and goddammit I still do
But just imagine if Einstein got high and sipped juice
Broke rules, got pussy, beat up rookies on Pro Tools
You probably call his ass Soul Brother #2
And I just took a number two
And ain't this track number two?


[Intro:]
One time for the women
Hit ya two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
That's right[Verse 1:]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you I'm just living how I'm living
Patron with a lemon, Pinneapple in the Ciroc
Vanity, more homes than the Sherlock family to roll through
Smoke up, fuck with a broad or two
I'm broader than you, (Murda!) I'm slaughtering you
She ain't gotta be a genius to see it
I just hope the brain make me say Jesus Christ
No religion, I'm just so explicit
I coexist in places you would never know existed
(What, what) Soulo here
Take a photo like a 4-seater
Top notch to my fucking socks
Say I'm not, you smokin' rocks
She on my jock, that's reasonable
If she pop a Xanny and give me the panties[Hook:]
She'll never leave me alone
Shit, I swear I just met shorty like 40 minutes ago, and it's a go
Man I hope she don't think I think she a ho
Got me harder than sneaking a bitch in Bohemian Grove
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
The bitches[Verse 2:]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you I'm just living how I'm living
Hennesey and Coke, 1800
We mixing dark and light like the 1800s
And we getting blunted, what it do? Yes, indeed
Bet I got some weed like Schoolboy Q
Let the festivities begin, we in here (what), we in here (what), we in here
Where them hoes at? I'm sincere as Nasir
Belly of the beast, I might feast on my dear
We night ride like Paul Revere
Spilling Mai Tais all on her brasiere
Top notch to my fucking socks
Say I'm not, you smokin' rocks
She on my jock, put the key in the door
If she pop a percocet and give me the sex[Hook]
Hey baby, I been thinking of you, hey baby, I been thinking of you
Hey baby, I been thinking of you, hey baby, I been thinking of you
Look at my mind, floating away
I get so illuminati
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you I'm just livin how I'm livin
Control [x3]
Stimulate the hoes
Control
Educating my niggas
Control [x2]


[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out Haile Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Babylon, Babylon
At my window all I see is Babylon
On the news all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows
I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I woulda more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs - just to name a few
I do drugs, Mama say it's in my blood
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
To creep through the back door, the typical black boy in the good old U-S-A
Before I pushed rhymes like weight, I used to wanna play for the NBA
Fuck I'm doing talking bout pineal gland
Ancient ways it's Sumerian
Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man
This why I had to write this man
For my niggas on the corner
Selling water to somebody's daughter
Fluctuating prices man
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I-I just wanna be free
I ain't tryna be nobodies chattel[Hook][Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Extra pills, Extra pills
Them AK Clips they extra peel
Smoking on some of that extra kill
Purple Urkel, that Jaleel
I put that on errythang
If we could link up erry gang
And niggas is willing to bear the pain
We'd put the White House lights out today
Okay-kay-kay
We guarded like we the black KKK
Don't forget my AK-a Mayday
Pee on your P-H-D or your AA
Dear Barack
I know you just a puppet but I'm giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain't nothing
And I just love it, I hope it don't stop
I don't give a damn, nigga bang that block
I don't give a fuck, nigga bang that Glock
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the twin towers dropped
Peep the concept
You've got progress, you've got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't finna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobodies chattel[Hook][Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Extra pills, extra pills
Nose 'Candy Rain' like Soul for Real
My baby need some enfamil
So bask in stuff like Oprah green
Pull around, come back, oh forreal?
Talk blue off low for some teal
Get lined up like homeless meals
Filling, if I know how being homeless feels?
Okay-kay-kay
Don't try to stop it, get in my way
You'll get stomped like a Broadway play
AK-melee, make her obey, okay?
Feel my pain, going insane, I'm ashamed
Cause I ain't got shit but an EBT card from a fiend
That owe me and it's in her daughter name
How the fuck is they pose to eat?
How the fuck am I pose to eat?
Got a nigga in the streets, no health care
Tryna slang weed just to put shoes on his feet
So fuck you, you don't give a fuck about me
Can't get a job cause they drug test me
Got a nigga stressed oppressed
Got a feeling in his chest
And the world's stripped of happiness
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobodies chattel


[Verse 1:]
Uh, It was all a dream, I swear it never happened
I wrote like Edgar Allen, I was po' like Edgar Allen
Let me hit the weed, you know I really need that
Missing screws, bending rules like kneecaps
I don't even know what's real, I'm just being real
Making moves, you just another human being; being still
Play the fool, you jealous dudes are just a plate of food
Tell the truth, I'm the coldest cat, sabertooth
Blaze the booth, blaze the buddah, this ain't hookah
You hit this shit a few times, you might see the future
Ask my nigga Blocka, we be rolling up that Blanka
Just retire, if I light this fire I might blow your block up[Hook:]
Enjoy your mind trip but don't trip on your mind
No man is safe from the war going on outside
That's right, you ever been conscious in a coma?
Please don't tell my mama this ain't marijuana
I might be tripping off that DMT
TDE, Limitless like we on NZT
I made my dreams reality, so to speak
Or so they say, I could still be asleep[Verse 2:]
The black sheep running with a pack of wolves
Diamond in the rough, tell Brock I need a pack of woods
Two white cups full of codeine
Plus I got two white sluts down to blow me
Can't you see I'm floating, like root beer and ice cream
My synapses act like lightning, probably why I'm so enlightening
Probably why these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm lookin like "who the fuck invited them?"
They failed in testing like what's inside of them
(Soulo, Soulo) Say it like you mean it
My demeanor is the meanest, I'm gettin meaner by the minute
It's mine, I spend it, my mind is spinning
Your time is ticking, the sky's the limit
We in a space where matter don't matter
Just spirit molecules and geometric patterns
Shitted in a crater last time I sat on Saturn
Got a letter from Andromeda, they tryna shrine my bladder[Hook][Verse 3:]
I'm in a whole 'nother realm, go to hell
Last nigga tried to scratch the surface broke a nail
Last nigga tried to cross the line got crucified
We overseas, back-to-back, never wore Chanel
The new nucleus never sitting in a cell
Genius idiot, best description of myself
I'm in a fucking lab coat rhyming as high as shit
When I die, donate my organs to science bitch[Outro: x3]
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, but you can never see us


One time for your mind[Verse 1:]
He with the homies, he with the homies
No squares in his circle, nobody phonie
He with the homies, he with the homies
We don't love them hoes, let's get this money
He got a main chick, been with her for a while
Love making, and making out
His fellas in his ear, "you acting like a queer"
You going on dates, we tryna get this cake
The pressure be setting in
If you a real man, you would fuck her friend
Head saying no, other one saying yes
His girl girlfriend been with it, it's scandalous
Unfasten her clothes, is what you gonna tell his soul
The thrill of it all got him off, case closed
He hesitated, and she say "why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy"[Hook:]
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard[Verse 2:]
She with the girls, she with the girls
Hair done, nails done, no care in the world
She with the girls, she with the girls
They all wifey material, yes sir
She want a boyfriend, she been missing out
On love making and making out
But she ain't having the best luck
Everybody who chop it up only want a cut
One of her girlfriends got one
She been jealous of the relationship since day one
But last week he made a pass at her
She knew she had him, her ass a little fatter
Unbutton his jeans and then she fell to her knees
She finally found company for her misery
He hesitated, and she say "why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy"[Hook][Verse 3:]
See the moral of the story is
She a ho, he a pimp
Old girl'll forgive her man
But her girlfriend's cut off like Edward's hands
What's fucked up is he got at her
Bitches call her a rat, but shit she's heard worse
To my niggas having bitches, it's what you just do
To the bitches having niggas, this what a slut do
My auntie told me always treat my lady right
My uncle told me only love 'em for a night
You can see the immediate disconnection
Between a man and a woman, the reason for aggression
For example, you heard of Amber Cole
But you don't know that nigga that was getting dome
I'm saying we heard of Amber Cole
But we don't know that lil' nigga that was getting dome
It's just my interpretation of the situation[Hook]


[Hook: x2]
One time for my niggas poured up yup, bachelor
We get screwed up like the neck of Frankenstein
Purple weed, purple drank, purple swag, purple tag
We be getting dough, We be getting dough[Verse 1:]
Just copped a pack of backwoods, I'm sitting high as hell
This OG kush suits this honey very well
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got her foe, that's right I'm tryna get dough
Hit my nigga AJ, heard he bought an 8th
My nigga Legend blessed me with a cup the other day
Hit my nigga Carver D, Dough boy it ain't crack?
Tell him it's a pole party, ASAP
Bumping out the speakers, coffee cups with lids
This way nobody accidentally ashin' in my shit
Got a few two liters and it's about to go down
Then again it's the prescription of choice
Just call us the Finnegan boys
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know, but you have no idea
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite?
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know[Hook x2][Verse 2:]
I got this funny little dream of buying out the bar
Then flexing in my section like a fucking star
They ask me what I like to drink and I say I'm alright
Then all you see is my purple sprite, glistening off of the strobe light
No jolly ranchers, this ack? is all I need
I hope it ain't cliché to shoot Pimp C a RIP
As well as DJ Screw since I made up this tune about lean
But as of late, all I see is poe like Section 8
The homie say he's got a few tings
That's three 16s and a whole lot of cream
I crack a ceiling, drope a douce now I got mixed emotions
From here on out, it's slow motion
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know, but you have no idea
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite?
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know[Outro: x2]
Coming down, still sipping
Draped up dripped out, still sipping


[Intro:]
(Soulo taught me...)
See yeah my nigga see
See yes this where that sci-fi met swag my nigga
Like the Holy Bible and a Gucci Bag
My nigga, swag![Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Oh you the kid, I'm Joseph Kony
Chip off the block, it's puffy socks in my Saucony
I touch stock, she suck cock
She dancing Secret Sundays and I'm 'bout to pray
I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
She got that magical vaginal let me hocus poke
Row, row, row my boat gently down your stream
She into Alexander McQueen but she ain't met the king
(Soulo, SOULO, Soulo, SOULO) kiss the fucking ring ho
TDE we got the belt, "hold it down if nothin else"
And this is my new single, cut the cheese it's bout to melt
Lean in my cup, pinky up like Dr.Evil
Currently we seeing deeds like Adam Sandler
ScHoolboy Q, OG, and dirty pineapple Fanta
And I ain't never been a motherfucking lick 'less I'm right around the clit
Druggys with' hoes, O's and 4′s[Hook: x2]
I'm smokin dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag's so mean, on them fucking hoes[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Oh that's your bitch? Well bruh she on me
I made her lick my sack, then work the top, then fuck the homies
Got the block hot, 'cause I sold it off
No I'm not Weezy, bitch I'm weezy from that chronic cough
Yeah, I'm smoking dope, you can smell it in my beard
Have no fear, saviour of the gangster rap is fucking here
Word around town, SOPA tryna shut it down
How that sound I'm from the underground
They're gonna make me slang a pound
Figg Row (Figg Row) Figg Row (Figg Row)
Bitch, what you know about Figg Row (Figg Row)
This is original gangster, Uh, uh, uh, yeah
Smoke it, chewed it, sniff it, smell it
Inhale it, sip it, whatever
Just mix dope with your flavor uh, uh, uh, yeah
In interviews they always asking me about a lisp
Knowing damn well I'm looking like I'm slinging bricks
Ever seen an ex-student get a half a ticket
Think I'm lying? just ask Jimmy, that check was mine to...[Hook x2][Verse 3: Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q]
Soulo ho! Groovy Q!
I'm high as fuck, look at me too
Won't pass the weed, but I'll pass a bitch
Fendi on, I might throw a fit
Deadline, hoodie on like Trayvon
Heard it through the grapevine
We got extra pills, lean and shrooms
Life for me is just weed and brews
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it, get get)
(Soulo taught me)


[Intro: BJ the Chicago Kid (and Ab-Soul)]
Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that)
Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Me) Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that)
Your body's calling
Your body's calling me[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Alright, I know what you like, I know what you want
I know what you need, I know how to put you out your misery
A-B (dash) S-o-u-l
Infinity when it comes to the possibilities
Anytime you're in my vicinity
And I'll beat it, yeah I'll beat it up, yeah I'll beat it up
Just like it's my enemy, all night
I can't resist, I need it like my pancreas
If you dismiss and no give me kiss kiss, it'll be hard digesting it
Gimme some of that, gimme some of that
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Back it up til a nigga say that's enough
Mirror on the ceiling, everything looking up
Sweetie, I'm trying to get it in like a suite key
Your skin like sweet tea, I need thee
Look sweet thing, you remind me of my jeep, your body's calling
She got work but I think she finna call in, cause I'm all in that thang
And she probably think I'm in love the way I'm falling in that thang
Soulo[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
This strange thing got me leaning
This reefer keep on steaming
And I believe that everything happens for a reason
And girl you got me fiending
I don't care about your religion
Cause I just can't resist you
God damn lust demons[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock, Rock
Leaning like a motherfucker, I be pouring
(Black Hippy Shit) higher than a motherfucker, I be blowing
I'm off that Amber Kush with a bad little bitch call it Amber Rose
She be loving the crew and I be loving her too
She got a thang for them rap niggas I suppose
She feeling my energy
I feel on her thighs, she fill up the Henessey
Now we on the sofa, in a minute I'm a be bending her over
She know my motives, tryna get behind me like a locomotive
She trained, she on the right track
Yeah she got that boomerang then I'm coming right back
She ratchet nasty
She got a ring on her tongue and a ring on her clit
Got my hands on my YKK, sip it down, now she all on my tip
She told me, look at me when I work my magic daddy
She pulled a rabbit out a hat
Made my dick disappear, in thin air
Then she brought it right back[Hook]


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end
Up happening, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius
Gripping my fucking penis, living this life
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild
Too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, okay then
Further more we do this for y'all
Rap is stressin' but it pays great
That is until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fifth and a loaf of bread
Feed the people, food for thought
Because we are equal, who'd have thought[Hook: Ab-Soul & Kendrick]
They wanna share my light [x8]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light [x2][Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Now I feel like I'm runnin' laps around Jay-Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty
B.I.G. & Pac got it coming when I pass too
You got the mic, I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPoWeR on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too I'll when I jot these words
True eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though
Like Cold get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes
On P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty
The best author ever to breath
And as we proceed to follow these dreams
I ain't losing no sleep
No, no at them no doors
Just know "No" if it's no dough
So high but I'm Soulo
Two cups and I sip slow
Taking my time
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show
Now let's go[Hook][Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time I drop line for line
But only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine
And cop 30 nines and cock back and kill
See the truth is, they wanna know how close me, Dre and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to be 2Pac
But truth I give two shits 'bout
Expectations or critics hating
Shit, I just put moms on vacation
Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the motherfucking King dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness
The Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tip like Kinta Kunta
Black is back bitch I'm the the coupe-da
Black on black crime resent the shooter
Black, black, black, I intend to mute you
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game so please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch see the grip on my fingertip I can hold this coast together[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
See, I just wanna take my chopper
And aim it right at that copper
Just locked up my partner
...they can't stop us
I'm prolly all alone on this one [x4][Bridge: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale
I'm prolly all alone on this one [x2]
Prolly all on this one [x2][Hook:]
Who's bold enough to rebel?
Re... bel
Re...
Who's bold enough to rebel?
Re... bel

That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint
That's the jam
Turn it up
Play it again
I might all alone on this one [x9][Verse 2:]
I just wanna grab that heater
Run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher
For miseducating the people
I might all alone on this one [x4][Bridge: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale[Verse 3:]
I just wanna take that banger
And aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger
I can't even trust my neighbor
I know I'm all alone on this one [x5][Bridge: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale
I know I'm all alone on this one [x3][Hook:]
Who's bold enough to rebel?
Re... bel

That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again

Turn it up

[Intro:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love[Verse 1:]
Pants still saggin' to the floor, saggin' through your turf
Like I own this fuckin' earth, I saw my fuckin' life
I'm just livin' fuckin' life, This ain't house Party 5
But what's poppin' for tonight? I got a 'lil more dough to spend
This Rest in Peace up on the LB like Nate did
Y'all ain't smokin' y'all jokin', Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm tokin'
Bomb House on Skid Row ain't this potent, holy shit
I'm God-Sent, admire my skit, callate la voca in the presence of the most high (power)
Most high (power), Most high (power)
Yea you heard me right, true achiever, new ADIDAS still tryna earn my stripes[Hook:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2][Verse 2:]
It's easy to assume we doin' decent, true indeed
I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent
Were you the Prius, sure it's one, it's two, it's 3
You'd have this music down to a Tee if you was me
It's 36 O's in a Ki, it's only one in Ab -Soul
Still open do's, Don't forget the dash
I might leave you with a gash, I ain't doin' no more shows unless I'm gettin' cash
Feelings full of Hash, city on my back nigga
Fucked around and put the llama on the map
Carson, Californication no travel agent
But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I ain't complanin'
And everyday I'm rainin' got the most precipitation
Soul-o, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, where's your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch and pry patience
And watch us pop across the population[Hook:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2][Verse 3:]
Do that shit, we done that shit
You new to this, we run that shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick
Down for what I'm up against, clownin' when you see me
Stylin' jokin', smilin' sculpture poker face, through these black shades (Smokin' on Haze)
In the middle of the bar, at least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 & 38 (Great)[Hook:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I got seven hundred dollars from my last show
And I would spend it all on you
So baby won't you fall on through
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
It's been a little while since the last time I saw you
What's up with you and ol' dude
I hope everything is all cool
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...[Alori Joh:]
Can you feel, what I feel
When I feel, What I feel
Empathy... Empathy...[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Lady if you would just give me the time
You could just leave all your problems behind
You got a past, but that's in the past
And we all know that, you can't press rewind
I understand, where are you and
I lend you a hand, if you wanted mine
Pamper you and stand for you
The man to, make everything right[Verse 3: Javonte & Absoul]
I guess things ain't going as well as you expected
But baby don't stress it, I hope you learned a lesson
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
I tell you I've been down that road before
If anyone can feel you then it's me
So won't you let you garments hit the floor
And let me let you feel me
Lights please, lights please
Light-skinned, mighty fiesty
Oh oh, I see, I see
You like me too[Hook: Alori Joh & Ab-Soul]
Can you feel, I feel, I feel
Empathy


[Intro:]
Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would[Verse 1:]
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
I can't even take a piss without a nigga trying to take a pic
I just want to fuck a few hoes, take my pick
Backwoods with the hash in 'em bad bitch, skinny jeans, fat ass in 'em
You ain't never seen a lime of light
I might fuck around and do a line tonight
Codine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fucking to the Weeknd, on the weekend
That ain't too provocative, is it?
If it's not, that's just a warning
You know I got it if you want
No, I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No this shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
No, I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something[Hook:]
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
It's always something
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would[Verse 2:]
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
We in the world of material vixens in your videos
Hermes belt, shirt will make your ho melt
Issey Miyake all over my body
My heart beats off beat, still the life of the party
YSL, iPhone wireless cell
I'm high as hell, by the end of the night
I might need bail if a nigga test my mic
I ain't a bitch for nothing, end of discussion
And I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No that shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
No, I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something[Hook]


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
My only fear is fear itself
I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself
Niggas looking at me like I don't hear myself
Like I don't know pain - I been here myself
(This life will drive you crazy)
Only if you let it
I'm just an American expressin' - Just give me credit
Won't be surprised if before I rise, I'm beheaded
These are the days of our lives
Nightmares of a thief comin' takin' my life
I go to sleep thinkin' I may never wake up
In this reality, at least I keep my bed made up
I just wish they all could see what I can see
If we could stop it with the violence and apply a lil' logic I believe
We could thrive to be a promise, see - Civilisation
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time, until it's our time[Hook:]
(Don't be so afraid to die)
Until it's our time
(Don't be so afraid to die)
It's not time, till it's our time
(Cause we'll never die)[Verse 2: Ab Soul]
All I see is confusion and chaos
Blatant disorder, authorities pickin' on the minorities
Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me
And got me awfully thinkin' about offin' me
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being broke and even worse
The upper class acts like they want me off this earth
(This life will drive you crazy)
Only if you allow it
That's only if you a coward and you're sure to get devoured
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power
Who's gonna take a stand, who's gonna be a man?
Who do you work for? Please help me understand
You could be the victor in a situation
We may die individual, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time, until it's our time[Hook][Verse 3: Punch]
Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shooting back at the balcony
Escapin' in a Lorraine until they call in the cavalry
Out from 184, oh lord, nobody blast for me
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
Nigga show me to the slaughter
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved
Sow my seed, so my seed can live it's dreams
My spittin' image, see my stitching in his genes
According to my likeness, this breath of life is priceless
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans
Penetratin' America's culture, to it's very being
It's not political though, it's more critical
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life
Beautiful death, nigga[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Tragedy after tragedy, it's sad to see
America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity
Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece
Put down your piece, I'm wish you all a beautiful death
Peace


Your momma told me read the book of Job
They shoulda called it the book of soul
I came into this hurtful earth in perfect health
Caught Steven Johnson syndrome when I was ten years old
Internal and external fever
80% fatality rate at that time
Ain't that some shit
Severe pink eye
My eyes swollen shut
For like two or three months
It still bright as fuck
And I even lost my lip skin
Grew back darker than it's original pigment
Skin disfigured from boils and blisters
Unidentifiable by my little sister
Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check
The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'm alright
My first years of junior high school were not alright
Them dimes wouldn't give me no time
No, not a nod
I mean not even you
We eventually got cool
But I was nobody
You was the hottest hottie in the school
But the world to me
Not saying that cause I'm your dude
I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed too
Ironic we always had the same classes
I copied off your work
And you ain't always had the right answers but it worked
Mama, thanks a lot
Probably wouldn't have graduated had you not
Somewhere down the line, we became an item
The love was in the air like this flight I'm lightin'
The first few years was so excitin'
Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back
My money got funny
You wanted to go on dates
I had a Soundwave beat tape tryna be Drake
Could've spent every minute with you but I had to get it
For me and you
You sing too so you knew the business
I know it was hard but you stayed down
My fam had doubts
You told me you was proud
I did some things, you did some things
Always came back together
We knew the only way to make it work was work together
Seven whole years, seven whole years
It was supposed to end with our grandkids
Luckily for me I'm used to being cut short
But I'm such a nice guy, why Lord?
Why Lori?
Why'd you have to take her from me?
Guess you needed your angel face for all of heaven to see
Your picture still on my mirror and it's so scary
I swear I still ain't looked at your obituary
So now I'm so doped up I think I'm flying
I hope the spliff will never finish
I guess the Mayans wasn't lying
2012 my world ended
You used to say that I could see the future
You was wrong, cause you was in it
And I was just with you the day before
You said you loved me, I said I loved you more
And as much I wanna cower and bid the mic adieu
And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you
I gotta stay cause I remember that day I looked you in the face and told you nothing can stop me
Not even you
Stick to the plan
I'll meet you at our spot
If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost
Even if you forget me and everything you left behind
I never lied
I love you in a place where there's no space and time
I close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud
We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about
I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme
Signed
Sincerely yours
I live to let you
Shine[Interlude]
Everything I love most get taken away
My momma and music is next
And if that happens before I turn 28
Then I'm going out with Curt Cobain
I still believe in God, we jut ain't never spoke
Unless we talkin symbolically then I might agree
But if you really wanna look at it that way then
Hey man
God don't like me
I refuse to believe that
But what's acceptable is anything's possible
But nobody special
My ma took my TV, - took my radio
Now I'm on TV and on the radio
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and keep them locks off your soul [x2]
(Soul!)


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I too have gone insane
Before I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, and a pebble hour bitch stand the rain
Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
Of every person I despise since the moment I turned 5
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, Roman Reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Counter-tops, we hop over, hit the register then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool bitch
K.Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, and then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliche to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make em' pay double
Anxious when I'm banking on the table I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin' LA, now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward dog, I'm trynna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit I'm actin
Suckin' on titties since I was 8
Hoodie with my shades I ain't trynna be fake
So don't be talking to me pussy
Runnin' your gums like you be loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than if you fabric
I won't have it, when the gun drawn get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas movin'
You hesitatin' to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin'[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetratin', bitches poppin' percocet and percolatin'
Freelance for God but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number 1+1, gettin' fed like where drugs and guns come from[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shittin' on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with' a uzi
Peel off in a dooney, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, and poke on some coochie
I'm just fuckin' around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head -
I'm Jay Rock, you norm' niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil, with two left feet?
Peep, thinkin' you sweet but you weak
Talkin out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember my nigga, I'm not goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit' proof, recruit a hunnit' troops who love to shoot
No fluke my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt city mayhem
Choppers that sprayin' from AM to PM
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blastin' a 50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe tagging wack rappers off GP
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smokin' on that seaweed, we rollin' up that kiwi
In the backwood lightin', we high for like 3 weeks
You payin' for that pussy but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg Conglomerate, HiiiPower, bitch


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
Hey Ali? Yeah that's right
I can hear myself good now, finally[Hook - SZA:]
Is this how it is These Days?
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to move These Days[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Your soul sits on your third eye, Soul sits on the throne
Told you I was the third wheel, that's three wheel motion on chrome
Three's up, three's up, all around the world
We ain't shooting no jumpshots, but we balling, we balling
I'm from where they get jumped or shot 'til they falling, they falling
They ain't heard one word from God but he calling, he calling
I ain't never had a whole rack, til' I was 24 years old
At 25 I spent a hunnid' of those and still ain't got nothing to show
Uh, I guess that's how it is These Days...
Uh, I guess that's how it goes
Cause this world is dark and my Locs is on but I ain't afraid
ABC everythang, every M you end up with is owed
And that's simple math, I had to balance the good and bad
No masters but a mastermind, Master Kush up in my bag
Soulo in the backseat, in a thing with some tints on it
With a thing with some tits on her, and every nigga in this bitch own her
Soul![Hook - SZA][Bridge - SZA:]
These Days, in chains
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
Fuck
My girl died and I lost my mind, I'm off everything except Heroin
Blame God, don't blame her. All I did was take gangsters to church
Got your lady with literature under her Louis bag
Got your kid studying outside of class
Every project that I dropped she bought em, so now she read more than she Red Bottom
Ab-Soul, Abstract, Asshole I'm with the shit
I say cuz around Bloods and I say Blood around Crips, I'm twisted
Got Mary, got Lucy, got Molly, that's wifey, girlfriend and mistress
Ain't no going against me man make another plan, pop a Xan
Forget it
Hahaha, that's how it is These Days
Yeah that's how it goes
Cause we ain't choose this life it chose us, so don't show hate cause she chose us
I'm just stacking paper, get yours up
Lil' nigga finish your chores up
That's my word I got shows booked
Got that Purp I pour fo's up, stole the show this a hold up
Ho-Hol up, Soulo Ho, there is only uno
Puto uh, Top Dawg out of this world pluto on pluto, you know[Hook - SZA][Bridge - SZA:]
These Days, in chains
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days[Outro - Isaiah Rashad:]
God's Reign
These Days...
Yo, y'all got some more trees?


Quiero vivir como los árboles
Breathe Easy!
Trees, trees, trees
Soul! 
I just wanna, I just wanna
LT3 shit, nigga, look
I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But I'm about to go on tour
Can't wait for wind, pollination to plant my seeds in the soil
Around '07 TDE Struck oil
It's my turn, Mr. LongTerm of turmoil
I'm holdin' up the terminal takin' flicks
I'm irritated but they're the reason that I'm gettin' rich
Cheese, Give me an upgrade, see
Then I'll be on my way, I'm on my way to NYC
Last time I was there I swear I sold out SOBs
In Times Square with my circle of G's, you nah mean?
Fuck you niggas with your hands out
Suck my third leg while I branch out[Hook:]
Cause I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But this money got me on the run
And it don't grow on trees, I'm tryna get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, Get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, Get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, Get me some
Shit don't grow money on trees, breathe easy!
I got most of you motherfuckers stumped
Rap like I go to church with work in the trunk
Lord forgive me but my pennies turnin' into dubs
I'm losin' my sense, they say I changed up 
And I don't feel no different, I'm still the same nigga
Maybe my brain's bigger, gettin' brains quicker
Used to cop a little deuce
Now I cop a whole case of Actavis to give Sprite stock a boost
Ab-Soul, yeah I'm gettin' loot 
Bitches walkin' bow legged out my dressin' room
Was at the Travelodge but now we at the W
Just to shower, be out in an hour, I got shit to do
Plenty empty Backwood packs in your face
In my backpack more OG than your hood, dang
Hey, can't live without the Benjamins
But I'm interested in Photosynthesis[Hook]
Me and She sittin' in a tree
K.I.S.S.I.N.G
First comes love, then comes marriage
Fuck that! I'm just tryna get up in your panties
Where the trees, trees, trees
Where the trees, trees, trees, trees
Burn the motherfuckin' trees, trees, trees, trees
With the trees, trees, trees, trees[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
It's still World Domination
Keep a Backwood and a motherfuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team
Nigga it's still a World Domination
Keep a Backwood and a motherfuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team
Heaven ain't far Curtiss, it ain't far at all my nigga
Check, Joey I know I told you, quote it in a verse
But we called it the third eye when it could really be the first
Wha gwan Jah no rarseclart me
I took it to heights these parasites can't see
Rarely do I bark, hope you get the analogy
Top Dawg Ent barkin' on the whole industry
Niggas get to bitin', I be like Breathe Easy!
Your cardiovascular isn't fast enough
I'm Canibus smokin' cannabis, sippin' Actavis
Before the Mathers diss I used to work at Magic Disk
With a dollar and a dream, why you think money is green?
Color of vegetation, the most important thing Trees
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
(Money is the anthem...)
People treat you real nice when you got fifty dollar drawers on
(Get money, fuck bitches)
I'm tryin' man
(Fuck bitches, get money, get money)[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Who gettin' that dough? Who gettin' that cake?
Who gettin' that bread? Put a ticket on your head if you can't relate
Who gettin' that fetti? Who gettin' that cheese?
You know I gotta eat, you know I gotta eat
Who gettin' that paper? Who gettin' that guap?
Who smokin' that top shelf? Who gettin' top off top?
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Who gettin' them commas, makin' mamas do kama sutra
Best act like you know, I'm gettin' them checks, I'm spendin' them checks
THC through TSA on my back, don't get checked
Who gettin' them Benjamins? Spendin' them with executives
Business man, understand, I'm on fuckin' tour, you on the 10-6, I'm reelin' in
Currency, won't pass the weed but I'll pass the bitch
My stock risin', you cock ridin', I'm splittin' clits where the money clip
Who gettin' that money, money? Real mothafuckin' money, money
That’s all I do dawg, got cashed out
Got fucked up, then I passed out[Hook - Mac Miller:]
Woke up early, kissed this bad bitch
Rolled me up a blunt, then I took a piss
Can't remember what I did last night
I'm just tryin' to spend a hunnid stax everyday of my life
Money is the anthem
Black girls in the bedroom, white girls in the bathroom
Fuck what I did last night
I'm just tryin' to spend a hunnid stax everyday of my life[Verse 2 - Schoolboy Q:]
Who gettin' that dough? Who gettin' that bread?
Get money I pledge, what you mean you broke bitch, open them legs
Now let a nigga be, I think I'm gonna skeet
You know I love cheese, you know I love cheese
I'm high as a scraper, I'm smokin' that guap
Who leave guns on the top shelf? Who keep Glocks on Glocks?
Ain't nothing more important than a hoover
Who hoppin' out cars, unloadin' that pop, pop, yawk, yawk, move ya'
Fi-Fig- Figueroa, gotta a .45 right here up in my coat
You can have my ho but don't hit my dope
I'm burnin' up like a parliament
I'm 216, I'm suspendin' rent
You a bad bitch, come fuck me
Yeah you heard it right, I said fuck me
Put that on Crip, even ignorance is bliss
I love foreign tits and her clitoris
Beat the pussy down like my nemesis
Make the pussy drip like I slit her wrist, but
Who gettin' that money, money? Real mothafuckin' money, money
That’s all I do dawg, got cashed out
Bought a new bitch and a new house like[Hook - Mac Miller][Outro:]
So before we go out, what’s your address?[Outro 2 - Puff Daddy:]
What? It ain't no more to it! Soulo eatin' now! Tell 'em Puff said so


[Hook:]
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Rolling around like "fuck it"
Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling around like "fuck it"
OZ in this Benzo, rolling around like "fuck it"
Rolling around like "fuck it", rolling around like "fuck it"[Verse 1:]
That shit weak, your bitch weak that's too bad, my bitch bad
Smoke weed, I got plenty, take your quarter back like McNabb
Sip lean, I got plenty, I drop a ace in a liter now I got a quinceañera
Ever had a chick to do it on the dick to capoeira
Kick game like Martial Arts kick game like Marshall Law
On Tekken the homies got weapons Martial Law could happen any second
Getting money, blowing digits only sexing sexy women
Only sexin' sexy women only sex is sexy women
That like to do them nasty things you know I like them nasty things
Can't fuck with them whips and chains I got a bitch that do, but I ain't got no gavel
Baby wanna know what's under my belt maybe cause I paid so much for the belt
Call the car service, get your ass home, but just yesterday me and Agent J[Hook][Post-Hook:]
What's happenin'? [x8]
OZ in this Benzo
OZ in this Benzo
Just a lil' Carson, nigga [x8][Verse 2:]
You're so weak, you don't know me
Soulo so lowkey in Lord, legends, infinity
Oh God showed off inventing me
Me and K with the promoter
Drop the fo' up in the soder
I'm unraveling backwoods
And he's bending corners, just thought I'd warn ya
Whats happening?
I've been gone too long, but bitch I'm back again
Except this time I'm old
Had that Chevy celebrity the same age as me
With that gram in the glove-box, that's a 2 for 15
I mean[Hook][Post-Hook][Verse 3:]
You still weak, you last week
I'm next month, twist the next blunt
The homie got his chain took at the Mixed Nuts
Now we blowing big weed, lean mixed up
Nigga, don't get shit misconstrued
We gave y'all plenty time to dig our stuff
Getting women in the mood
We tell the truth up in the nude
Breaking news, breaking news
I'm enlightening like Pikachu
All I do is what you wouldn't think to do
Silk, don't you remember that [?]
South Pole Jeans, fat laces in all our shoes
A nigga turned into an oracle
Treat the damn booth like a urinal
Smoking a stogie in a terminal
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Rolling around like "fuck it"
Paul Jeremy, Doe and me trying to match a nugget
Pass the blunt to BC, AR, and AJ
King Rich, YM, Python P, I put that on me
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Capital C[Ab-Soul & A-Mack:]
I just might be in yo hood
(Fuck outta here man, you dumb ass niggas!
You niggas are silly out here tryin' to look cute and shit man)
I just might be in yo hood
(Quit playing. This is serious bruh, niggas wanna come talk to me about all this dumb shit; a nigga ain't tryna hear that man
I'ma come clean bruh, go sit down with all that my nigga)
This shits over here from the grass... [?]
I just might be in yo hood
(We gon' handle it, how handle it my nigga straight like that, bruh)
(Eh niggas out here look silly, my nigga
Like bruh, if you don't know me look at my fucking Twitter, my nigga)
I just might be in yo hood
(It's your boy A-Mack out here man, Zanzilla, slapping niggas and bitches for fun, straight like that)[Verse 4 - Punch:]
Niggas chased my uncle there, through God's grace the gun jammed
I found comfort in this pleasure, meaning I slept the best through gun sounds
These Days it's a little different, between me and my past I put a little distance
Egyptian cotton, thread count vicious
Started as a dream, manifested into little Kendrick
Now everybody feel it, even niggas who didn't know, they try to forget it!
Selective Amnesia, that's an Oxymoron, These Days
Niggas ask about pressure I grew up watching free base
Literally the face of my hood...
So basically I beat the case
I vanished but left a trace, just in-case a nigga gotta go back
Yeah, it's not for games if I say that[Hook - Ab-Soul & SZA:]
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood


[Intro:]
These days I'm so focused
Fast life, slow motion
These, these days I'm so focused
These days I'm so focused
Fast life, slow motion[Hook - Ab Soul & Nikki Jean:]
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
And life is but a dream
And I would never leave her
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me
And I be all night, no sleep, real talk
Go hard until the AM
You can have my shine, I give you my light
Opportunities you take them
And you can take your time on your own time
I be at the finish line waiting
Cause some people chase the world
Other people let the world chase them, yo[Bridge - Ab Soul (x4):]
We run, we run, we run the world (Get high)
We run, we run, we run this world (Yeah)[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Yeah, can you hear it?
I spread love, can you feel it in your spirit?
When doves cry shit get serious
You feel like a prince in a pharaoh's pyramid
Scheme turned dream turned nightmare on Elm Street
Ye ain't got your heart in the right place
How the hell you plan to stay on beat, on beat?
Yeah, I put that on me
I got a gun and a good book, leave all your homies holy, moly
Black sheep, no miss Bo Peep
Motherfuck police ‘til they release all of my OG’s
You could lean on me ‘til you Morgan Free
You don’t need no sleep[Hook] [Bridge][Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco:]
Can’t spell Illuminati without Lu can’t spell Lu without “u”
Can’t spill blood without blue now ask yourself what is what I do
Let you put that together without glue without screw, fast life
Built a time machine in my past life, a horror story about as long as Fukushima half-life
And mostly I’ll be ghost, and to talk about it have to rhyme into a flashlight
Now that’s a long way from blackface track that they using for your rat race
Connected to a cat face, you can ask them pussies how a lap taste
Maybe like cookies to a monster
Running miles to the mouths of meows coming out (high plane try not to be bomber)[Interlude - Nikki Jean:]
Full speed ahead, full speed ahead
To allow no limits, there are no limits
No limits allowed, no limits exist
Cause maybe, cause maybe
There are no limits[Hook] [Bridge][Outro - Ab-Soul:]
Go, go, uh
Yeah, no roof on the jeep with a big old chain
Niggas left for the sniff and came back for the base
You could tell he was tripping by the look on his face
No new jacks in my city
Aye, I’m feeling like G money, money, money
Yeah, uh, I’m feeling like G money, money, money
Yeah, no new jacks in my city
Bitch, I’m G money, money, money

No cat in this, I volunteered for these Hunger Games
I'm the one to blame for fucking up the frame

Fucking bitches in the PH not the PJs (Saudi)
Blow a hundred thousand dollar cheque
Got them goons on deck-
Be quiet, real killers move in silence (they do!)
Them killers they be wyling, them killers they be wyling, yeah
Pop a pill and peel your shit, that's TMI, but that's R and-[Hook]


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
Jinx what up my nigga?
Soulo
I get turnt, I get rowdy
Backwood full of some of the loudest!
I'm fucked up! I get wasted
That's a hundred dollar cup I just wasted!
I'm Twact!
(I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker I'm Twact!
(I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker![Verse 1 - Jinx:]
Uh, Twact out till I pass out
If you ain't fucking with the team then you assed outFlow dope like a crack house, bitches pill poppin'
House poppin' like a Frat House
Keep 16s like a verse nigga
Codeine got me leaning in reverse nigga
I popped a Xanny then she dropped her panties
I get the dough and bring it home, to the family
See I ain't fucking with you man if you ain't paying me
I'm from the village baby, I'm just tryna win a Grammy
Uh, smoking Backwoods back-to-back
Double cross the squad and get popped like Cracker Jacks
You see the look in my eyes so you know I'm strapped
A real Compton resident, yeah you know I'm that
I pulled up to the function with the pack
Turnt in this bitch to the max![Hook - Doeburger & Jinx:]
My nigga I'm twact (I get high)
Turkey bag full of that gas
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
Styrofoam cups, no glass
Nigga I'm twact (get high)
Got them bars on me, no rap
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
I don't even know where I'm at
Nigga I'm Twact![Verse 2 - Short Dawg:]
I just got home boy I'm glad I made it
The Codeine got me activated
New mix alert, Soul you have to taste it
Know I got the lean on me, like tax evasion
I mixed it with a whole lot of cannabis, mind travelling, getting throwed like a javelin
H Town slang I done poured up a Matt Schaub
Drugs got me like woah I'mma twact raw
And now on a mission just to get some cheeks
If she don't answer when I call, Imma hit delete
I don't love these hoes at all, boy I be with freaks
Cause they know if I fall it's gone be asleep
And I'm back on the road sipping mud again
Tryna stay inside the lines like I'm coloring
The cops say "I seen you swerving, tell me why."
I told em I ain't even gon' lie...[Hook][Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
Soulo ho, well known from Del-Amo to Soho ho
This ain't Arabian night but let me see your camel toe
I might even set up my camera too
Oh, do the splits on the dick like aerobics
Them other niggas talking shit but they don't know shit
No, they ain't on and ain't on shit
Yeah they on that, I'm on this...
And I don't need no necklace cause I be off the chain
And all they say is yes when everybody know your name
Got a pack of Jet fuel that they don't use for planes
Unless it's a metaphor for how high I'm remaining
Seals in the cut like Navy training, along with a couple other things I shouldn't be naming
Eh, Long Hair Don't Care, how come I'm the most faded in here?[Hook][Outro:]
BMB, TDE
Ladi-dadi we likes to party
We might cause trouble, we might body somebody
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ladi-dadi we likes to party
We might cause trouble, we might body somebody
Ah! Ah!


[Intro - Ab-Soul & Da$H:]
Have some fun out there
Smells like fucking dope in here
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Up jumps the Boogie bitch, I boogie board on these instruments
Riding the wave like a lie detector, if I'm lying I'm flying, nah
If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion
More fire, that's more fire, that's more fire, that's more
(smoke that weed nigga)
Set that mouse trap, you fuck around, yeah you fuck around and get smoked
Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp, burn that (roll that weed nigga)
We used to dub cassettes but now we poppin' Percocets
I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields
Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields
Wicked as Aleister Crowley do you niggas know the deal?
(Son, do the drugs don't let the drugs do you)
Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage and I'm telepathic too
Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms!
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room
I flow like, Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind"
That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs and I try to tell these motherfuckers all of the time (roll that weed nigga)
Don't forget my dash or you'll get left behind! (shake that ass up)
I'm fast, another one bites the dust just at the sight of us
They liking us, to lightening striking over Mount Everest
That ever so, talented establishment
TDE. Jay Rock, K Dot, ScHoolboy, me... Soul
(What up Zay? What Up SZA?)[Hook:]
When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face
Niggas talk more than bitches These Days
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days!
Just Have Some Fun (got that Dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just Have Some Fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just Have Fun[Verse 2:]
I just wanna teach you all about the mind
The power in it, the very power of mine
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye
Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice
Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like
So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice
That's why I read a lot of books, so I got straight A's
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage
I never paid tuition, but I paid attention
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission
Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in
(Met the devil in God's elbow)
And this is what he said...[Hook][Skit:]
Hi, my name is Jimmy
(Hi Jimmy)
I'm a friend of a rapper
You may, you may, also know me as the white Ab-Soul
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
I like Denim Jeans
And I'm an alcoholic...


[Kendrick Lamar:]
24/7, 365, motherfucker I'm still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you, my Plan B is to you win your hearts before we win a grammy
These Days ain't shit changed
Different toilet, same shit... and I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rapping
See these streets made me, broke me down, built me up, drove me crazy
Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
It don't make dollars it don't make sense nigga
By the way that's DJ Quik nigga
Respect or check it
These Days I'm a little more focused cause y'all cracked the door and I kicked it open,
yellin' get the fuck down or I will shoot
I told you [gunshots] not to motherfuckin' move!
Be another example, I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid? Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So These Days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothing compared
To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3s and the homie TuTu
Two more YGs
Ain't nobody got time for that!
These Days it's only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens, you make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records and wrote pieces, of history
So These Days? These accolades are meant for we
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be
T.D.E[Ab-Soul & BJ The Chicago Kid:]
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam[Ab-Soul:]
Shit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
I'm obviously ominous to my competition and if I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then!
We shared our life with you, shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers for rhyming like we had super powers
They should've never let us in these offices...
Knowing good and God-damn well how well we've been ducking officers
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!
I had my ups and downs but I always left right
Rest In Peace Alori Joh...
TopDawg for life!
And oh yeah...
SOUL!
I watch that fire that we have gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...


[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Yeah, yeah...
I called you back I'm glad you didn't answer baby
Cause every-time we talk I always feel the static baby
Could be the distance, yeah
You spoke the truth into existence to degrade yourself
Told me keep it G as if you told yourself
Knew that I was on the move
I got to prove my theories to be true[Hook - Ab-Soul & Jhene Aiko:]
I know it's getting hard to think about me
I know it's hard to see me on the TV
I know you wish you never met me
I liked you better when you didn't like me
Things just ain't the same no more
Things just ain't the same no more
Still think about you everyday
And I wish I could stay
But things just ain't the same no more[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I don't regret a second that we shared, hell no
In fact I often wish that you was here, right now, ow, ow
Cause' when Lori left me you was right there
Lord knows you had the right care
I wonder if you still praying to the East
I wonder if you ever forgave me[Hook][Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
I know I said it'll be just one time
But it felt so good that I came back twice
And I take full blame
But in this word of selfish men
You keep your heart inside your chest
And not in someone else's hand


[Intro - B-Diddy:]
You recording bitch!
Great minds... fuck each other
Uh, Let-Let me fuck your mind
(YMF Nigga)[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Na-Nasty motherfucker might fuck without a rubber-
Ducky, if you're lucky
Only if you're lucky though, don't tell my mother
Am-Am I too blunt? She said uh-uh, then I lit the blunt
Young Mind Fuck, what the fuck?
She was such a...[Hook - Ab-Soul & KR:]
Sapio Sexual
(think about it baby)
Let me fuck your mind

Sapio Sexual
Sapio Sexual
(Think about it)
Let me fuck your mind
(She got that thing twerking)
Let me-Let me fuck your mind
(She got that thing twerking)[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
Let me choke ya up (murder scene!)
Let me poke ya up (bomb bomb)
Pussy make you wanna call 9 (one, one)
Greatest of all time Like Mike (one, one)
Check mine (one two)
Now your brain is (All mine!)
Make it rhyme, why you worry about my double enten
To-Tongue on the clit, finger fucking (Throwing gang signs)
Oh shit, know them hoes told you bout the Druggies
Might lick your asshole don't judge me (Don't Wuwwy!)
Young Mind Fuck, what the fuck? yeah I'm in this bitch
And I'm in your bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm looking like (Switch!)
Light switch, click, then I'm in the mall like swish! (Baller mayne)
You with the hips, you and your uterus could use a lift
Uh, kiss the lips on your face and below your waist (Mwah)
Asking rhetorical questions like "who's is this?"
There is Only 1
She got that thing twerking and one thing is for certain
Yeah she a...[Hook][Bridge - Isaiah Rashad:]
Take em to church!
If you don't know man, better ask somebody
(Let me fuck your mind!)
If you don't know man, better ask somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
If you don't know man, If you don't know man
Better ask somebody![Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
Whatever you choose, whatever you do make sure he a thug and intelligent too (True)
Dumb as ditch but they'll still school you
Make you happy but fuck you like he mad at you
Pull your weave back, (lick around your areola)
Never sober (Always getting bent) Bent over!
Haha no really though, bend over and touch your toes mami, let me see what you can do
(Work!)
Crizzle my scrilla, Soulo that nigga
Soul!
(Work!)
Cole World!
Uh, little nasty
This one for my...[Hook]


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
Righteous man
Walk with me
Bear the burden, yo[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
No, no, don't do you dare, cast one stone in air
I'm cracking stone with bare hands, you're a mere man
I know my stoners here, all my visionaries
Shades in the night, that's a scary sight
I'm never in the dark though, my squad the brightest circle
Watch with the internet alone I enlighten the whole globe
That's iTunes from a nigga with astigmatism
I got it from my moms, thank you Steve Jobs
You took my grandpa job and you gave me a job
Not just a physical but digital way of displaying my rhymes
And making these kind people pay a fine
I've been through a lot, I deserve a lot, this work's fine[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I'm more than a man, I've been died and rose again
Left these holes in my hands, so you know who I am
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata (YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK)
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata[Verse 2 - Action Bronson:]
From the fiery pits, on some Dead Poets Society shit
Here to bring you a variety mix
Grab my dick, violently spit, cause I don't give a fuck
About the type of shit, batty boys are on, get your vaginas wet
And you shaking in your ballet shoes
At the restaurant we valet twos, bad news
Half moons on ten goons, uh
On the four wheeler shredding up the sand dunes
There's something wrong and that's quite clear
I smell deception in the night's air
That shit is sweeter than a ripe pear
For your love, I cut my right ear[Hook][Verse 3 - Asaad:]
Oh no, no, no they didn't, cause these ain't bars, these prisons
Walk with me, every step I take in these Visvims
Real rare breed, cut from the cloth like
A phoenix feather when I write, Molotov, yikes!
You seen them flowers bloom, know that they grew in despair
A blessing in disguise, nobody knew it was there
My crown had been made, I just had to put it on
Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song
And when my grandpa died I broke down and cried
But still I am more than a man, I am a God
Sweetest is pain amongst all of the thriller things
I been through enough and so I need all of the iller things[Outro:]
One of these days some simple soul will pick up the Book of God, read it, and will believe it. 
Then the rest of us will be embarrassed


[Intro:]
6:19 in the morning nigga[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Let me start off with this statement
I'm the motherfucking greatest
I ain't even have too many haters
All my niggas knew I was gon' make it
From performing at Pep Rallys, showcases, talent shows
That I had to sell tickets for, just to get up in that ho
Now raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
I'm rolling up in the tour bus
Just rolling up in the tour bus
Free said put the weed out they don't play that in Virginia
But I'm finna continue, pass the fire to my nigga Tone
Couldn't find a fire but this far from home
But we still trying, I mean we still chiefing
She thinks it's cool, she took a puff, she still freaking
I popped a bean, fell asleep, woke up, and started thinking[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
Man this shit pays hanging in the House of Pain

Cause they Feeling Us, they Feeling Us, They Feeling Us

Yeah I'm liquored up, this a celebration
TDE the shit... thanks to all you haters!
I'm Jay Rock, yeah the OG, me and Soulo blowing OG
Hit the stage, then beat the case, then get the cake, then burn trees
Shake hands, kiss babies, show love, throw 3s
I was on the block with a quarter key, like what the fuck is a 16?
I was so anti-social, nigga wasn't outspoken
Till I picked up a mic, story of my life!
Uh, came with the piece so keep the peace
Uh, I ain't tryna hurt nobody
I ain't sweating no vendetta, champagne on my breath in the hotel lobby
You feel me? Damn right you feel me!
Got them sigh, she feel me and them paparazzi feel me[Hook][Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
I'm feeling fine and dandy
Staying awake off this Xanny
Knock knock off this weed can one of yall find another Backwood please?
I just know that I can be, an example of what you can be
Making a way for my homies, making it easy for my family
So mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
No mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
Told me I'm smarter than you, you just gotta trust me yo
I stole from the record store, still selling, records though
Yeah...
(Love you Grandma!)
Ain't no shame, in my game
They know my name in Montreal, they sing my songs cause they relate
They Feelin Us, cause we can't be touched, thank God for Top and Punch
Ho-Ho-Hold on... Drop the drums
These bitches love Soulo, Del Amo to Soho
Fucking with them TopDawgs, you'll just look like toto
Do it all for Soulo, I don't even know them
Hol Up here we go again... Justin bring the chorus in![Hook]


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
Ain't no sitting down in here my nigga
Yeah [evil laughs]
Yeah keep-say-Oh I think niggas is laughing at me
That's right make that spooky shit
Yo-y-y-yo-yo look-look
I Ride Slow[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
These rhythms of visions of me living colossal, ahead of my time
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Know not what I do
Lord do you have mercy on my soul? Far as I know I'm a poet or in an apostle
Smoking my dro, smell the aroma on my clothes
Rose from the dirt, so I'm down to Earth
(Oh I know)
You made a few bucks now you feel buck
Your chains gold, my shades all black
I can do this with a blindfold
This ain't rap this is find a mine in your mind blow
Your brains back out of your wave cap, I don't know Tae Bo
But I kick that, you're a Kit-Kat
Life's sweet but, way down the line you're just a snack[Hook - Earl Sweatshirt & Ab-Soul:]
It gets cold on the road to the riches
(Yeah, I Ride Slow)
The cars and the clothes is expensive
(Yo, I Ride Slow)
These hoes with they nose in my business
(Yeah, I Ride Slow)
Nigga
(Yo, I Ride Slow)
These rhythms of visions of me living colossal, ahead of my time
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo
Insane in the membrane![Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I Ride Slow, live fast, small time to big cash
Cut corners, cut loose, cut class, fuck school
Had to learn though, the harder way
Pushing pennies but see a three's a 16 in my sport
Figure deal me I'm filthy I know it's greedy out here
I told you that but I made my way through it like Moses did with his staff!
Relax, and try not to step on the crack, that'll break your mothers back
On the surface I will certainly scratch
See Mac? He made this from scratch, just imagine what we could do with a flick of the wrist
Your puppets anyway, let's say I'm playing ventriloquist
Go this a way, go that a way, I'm scatter brain with this shit
What's that a K? Put that away, no weapons formed against, me... shall pass
Remember that? I'm biblical with this shit
The tales from the Crip, on the soul of Sunday schools finna flip
Oh! (blow)
The cameras gone so bring the acid tabs along and let's all gather round and sing my fucking song!
Yo, I Ride Slow...[Hook][Verse 3 - Danny Brown:]
Check!
I Ride Slow, sparking like exhaust, smite a pyro
A psycho, Xannys in my cup before I pour a fo'
You nacho, mean a nigga put cheese on you
Pulling up no headlights but there's red beams on you
Apostle, smoking on this dope my brain colossal
Helps out the flow to do tricks like a brothel
Roll the lace with Angel Dust and pages of the bible
Survival tactics, target practice if you lacking it get drastic
Caskets If you niggas talking ass backwards
Up shits creek with a tissue paddle, OG Kush make a nigga chest rattle
Call your number like you just won the raffle
Nigga you Snapple sweet come after me it's casualty
Turn you into vegetables as if i dropped the celery
The reality is all you niggas fictitious, smack you
With the hand of satan cause you need some sanitation
Any nigga hating we gon' turn them to a raisin
One nigga, 30 clip, turn your brain into bacon bits
And I ain't saying shit cause I'm coming from Detroit where
I'm coming up short then niggas Ride Slow, AK-ing up your porch
(I Ride Slow!)
(I-I-I Ride)
(I-I-I Ride)[Interlude - Doeburger:]
Niggas talking about all this lean shit, nigga I been sipping this shit since... been sipping this shit
(I Ride Slow)
Silly out here...
Niggas wanna tell me about 2 cups, nigga I gave this nigga Soul his first 2 cups nigga
I gave cuz his first cup of Lean
What you niggas talking bout?
(I Ride Slow)
Cuz older than me, that's what I be talking about see? fuck it
(I Ride Slow)
(These rhythms of visions of me living colossal, ahead of my time
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil)
Soulo[Hail Mary melody]
La-la-la-la-la
Do you wanna ride or die?
(I Ride Slow)
What do we have here now? Run quick see
Come with me, come with me
(Inhale Mary)
Come with me, come with me
(Exhale Mary)
La-la-la-la-la
(I Ride Slow)[Verse 4 - Ab-Soul:]
I heard they stopped making Actavis...
(You know when I heard that?)
While I was sipping Actavis!
Fast life, slow motion in my double cup
The screw give me drive like a flat-head, every fill up
I must be Captain Phillips
These niggas don't speak my language
Residue on my debit card, don't tell my moms
That it's a lot more than marijuana in her son
I walk on the dark side, only to shed light where they ain't no sun
Deadline Snapback on my mind, I ain't suicidal I'm just fly
My rhymes, Ciroc and Ayahuasca would you like a sip?
Enlightenment from a low life that's more than likely high
What I do with 8 zips nigga? You don't know the half
All these lines add up like a motherfucking graph
Rap as if I had 2 left feet, tryna walk a righteous path
So here's a question that I ask...
What's a negative with no plus?
A Benz with no bus?
A curse with no gift?
Who's God with no us?[Verse 5 - Delusional Thomas:]
Delusional, murder marsupials when I puke a flow
Put my dick in witches from the Crucible
I'm hard to get a read on, that pussy shaking, Parkinson's Disease on
Pardon me I sneezed, blessing conscious as I speaks freely
Death is cold homie, breathe easy
Loaded gun in front of me
Shoot the soul right out of Soul, yeah you my homie
You do my murder
Ay-ay-ay-ay
Fuck off! Maaaaaan
(I Ride Slow)
(Stop sniffing on that God-Damn bleach is what you need to do)
How dare a man talk about the potency of my pack?
I snort dope, it's mixed with Crystal Meth and gastric bypass
Satan's blood in my flesh
Nobody is high as, and These Days the iPad
Will tell you that your life will be no longer than an eyelash...
And then float away
(I Ride Slow)
So good luck![Outro:]
Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-
Fuck yeah!
Yo Doeburger man


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
All my life
All my life[Bridge - Ab-Soul:]
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was tight
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was sick
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was ill
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was I'll be here[Verse - Ab-Soul:]
Everywhere, tell the truth you wouldn't dare
Cross me like the gold you wear
Soulo flow like the solar flare in the open air
So much smoke that I'm comatose, but I still want mo'
TDE generals, she ain't spiritual but she still want Soul
God bless, God body, no fear in nobody, no thing
Can I proceed? Collect all of my proceeds
Don't I flow like I don't bleed? Every cut is just dumb
After me there will be none I told you there is only one (Soul)
Yeah, and I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's sober hopin' so it's 'stood
I'm in Hollywood cause I remember when I had 50 Cent, up In Da Club
All my life I knew I was major, I don't need no major
I don't even write rhymes, I really shouldn't have to sign paper to dominate the
Game yall praise on hand and knee, just waited till it came to me
I just kept it real with yall, keeping it real with me[Hook - Ab-Soul and JMSN:]
Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere
Trying to stay high, as long as we down here
Listen closely, see what we bout here
Who really bout that, you'll see when the smoke clears
Cause we really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here!
(We really out here, yeah yeah yeah!)[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
Uh, and it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
Fuck the same hoes again, bumpin' "Druggies Wit Hoes Again" with my bros again
No, I want the world chico and everything in it
Every beverage with Codeine in it
How the fuck you say I sold my spirit?
I'm still taking blows at the Senate
Claims of Illuminati, I'm just tryna Illuminate
Praise to the most high, God, Jah, Allah, Yahweh
Selassie eye and I'm proud to say, I never need a 9 by my waist
Niggass still respect my gangster, celestials respect my space
And I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's over ho, it's over stud
I was overlooked, I went overboard now I'm overbooked
Ab-Soul-Lute just, my life is like an open book
Read between the lines nigga
I did this shit legally blind nigga
Yeah, Soulo ho, Carson arson with Del Amo (Knock Knock!)
Tell your folks I said hello, I ain't never scared[Hook - Ab-Soul and JMSN][Bridge - Ab-Soul][Break - Ab-Soul (Interview):]
These days, at this point in my life, I kinda really wanna use music to help people get through their days instead of just staying in the dumps, just keep going. Bring light to the situation, maybe, you know, try to find your own personal message in that incident, that experience and try to move forward[Battle Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Y'all got me, everything good, y'all can hear me?
Before we start, lemme just say this, lemme just say this
I'm dating you Day
Wait, wait, pause
No gay shit
What's the difference between a date and a day anyway Day?
A date is a day that's marked
I'm smart, and just cause I know you love 'em so much
I came with name flips for days, tailored just for Day
I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds
My database said Day the basehead that date a basehead
Is he dope? No
Who gave Day the base, ball is what we do best
Flock his projects, that's a home run, Day
The baseball is what we do best
Carpe diem, that's how you say seize the day in French
I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life
I will never see the light of day again
Now witnessing this rare occasion I bear fruits of my labor this grape is green
I gotta eat on the go Day
I hope they told you that everything that Soul say don't go a long way
Don't go a long way, what?
A ho in Chipotle, no
This is food for thought, from a dog on top
We been nuts
There was a fool who thought we was new to this
But who knew this would end up, a glow stick and a uterus
That's light in a box
And that's light, that's light
But light like to lick twat a lot so that's right
That's what y'all call street?
No tales from the Crip this evening, he slip
Seems he forgot what the C meant
It's your dumbass fault that last part was so concrete
But I guess you'd have to be Ken to get that bar b, pardon me
I bet right about now you feelin' like Jordan down in the Jordan Downs
In fact it's crazy that you even play ball to clear your thoughts before raw backwards
And that's cool, but for this round, save the bull before you let the Jordan downs and Jordan down
Now, as for the crew
Well, uhh, the villain been itchin' to skin a dog
And this nigga bought, what, a hundred and three dalmatians?
It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it
And I'm a fan first
But it won't take too many seconds to leave you in a damn urn
You deserve this disservice
I put this man in ERs if he don't got no manners, man word
I'm expectin' some etiquette in your segment kid
I brought you to the 'Stu to show how we do
So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here
They can't see you
Wave your title to this tidal wave, we do
And you don't appear to be a peer to me, forreal
You should kneel to me or somethin'
Fuck it, to keep it 100
You're nil to me, that's nothing
Heard they been raisin' raisins down on Grape Street, that's crazy right?
That's what happens when you expose them grapes to too much daylight
So your chances of standin'
Much smaller than my plan to defeat you
Wait, what, do I gotta put it in photosynthesis or somethin', son?
Shed some light on Day?
'Til he's cropped out
No not now, I won't need a plant to defeat you
The sequel, this movie, won't need to be continued
You finally encountered somethin' you can't counter, coward
You're counterfeit
You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy
To see quill drug over the counter
After your mother consumed you, you were the fruit of the womb
After you were born, I'm sure you wore Fruit of the Loom
Now I'm tryna figure out, is you from Grape Street, Crip?
Or just another fruit in this room?
It's crucial, you choose, I'm sure you don't want me to assume
I should be against the law to run into
Cause we all know in LA I'm double you, all so true
Today is the day I split Day in two
What the fuck has battle rap turned Day into?
Are you from Gotham or from Watts?, Are you Batman, Spawn, or Davon?
Did you really think "Paul Walker" was a dope song?
If so, you were wrong
Hold on, I got one more, and don't lie to me
Do you really have a Batmobile outside, my G?
Don't be so transparent, this nigga's light - through
If you don't know what transparent means, let me enlighten you
If it's transparent, that means that it lets the light through
So I should smack this trans' parents for lettin' light through
Like, he nerve of this cat
Lyin' with a motionless emotion
This nigga Day all bitch
Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get kilt
Do Quill got skill at all, homie?
It was some Braveheart shit, all I heard was Nas, homie
Did you really expect to last, Day?
You know Revelations say that we livin' in the last days
I mean, I see you skimmed through Genesis and Timothy but did you get to that page?
You got Gats?
You think your little arm'll get in the way of Armageddon?
Forget it Day, no, really, forget this day
If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time to see
Just how many people would say "Yes" to Day
Nobody, fam, nobody, fam
That's why I'm ahead to day
No, no body fam, that's why I'm a head today
No, nobody fam, that's why I'm ahead of Day
Somebody check the clock, I think I'm ahead a day
Send him to the choppin' block, off with the head of Day
It's only right I be blunt to Lyt
I only gave Lyt a match to light a blunt
I see I should have used the lighter instead
Chill Loc, we ain't smokin' no purple
We need the fire instead
When I think of daylight, I think of shit like
Breakfast, morning, birds singin', kids playin'
See where I'm goin'?
That means you better break fast, or I'll have your family mournin''
When that bird sings, kid, I ain't playin' and you know it
But you know what?
(Hold on, hold on, let me get you right, we have this shit)
Take this 500 before you clap this shit up
Say this, let me say this, let me just say this
These flashin' lights got Lyt flashin', nigga, for the glory
You're Buzz Lightyears from here, Quill, and you tellin' toy stories
You boys bore me, that's why I'm hoggin' all lanes
All your bars Häagen-Dazs, that's on everything
Day a dairy queen, Deluxe, Blessed king
Dearly beloved, all first verse, all first verse
You know I brought a hearst for the sausage you brought worst
Dearly beloved, here lies this little light of mine that tried To let it shine
And I hate that we have to
Hear the lies from this little light of mine that tried
To let it shine
But I'm ill, you men ate when I finished Lyt
You get it, Lyt?
That's how you ILL-u-min-ate, and finish Lyt, good night
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get you right
You got that for me?)
Brought you some complimentary TDE ski masks[Battle Verse 2 - Daylyt:]
Question, you know how many copies The Matrix sold?
It don't matter, The Matrix's old
I double cats, I ask 'em if they seen the glitch
No, no, no
Face it, I got it covered
Prevail, they say the sail was a thread to Hell
The gravitational stitch cause some niggas seem down
They come up with this perfectly clean round
But I hope you not doin' this cause of fear
Of the pen, I'ma prove you pussy within
But I guess it's up to you to risk your career
I retire niggas, I'm the [?], I could OD too
And even the odds some
He thought he could least get a baby victory
But all he got was "Nah, son"
Check this out, he not ready
Either you fight back or I ether you
Thought you could face what I hand you, well this is impeccable
Soon as I took a peek at you, you looked shocked
Peep at you, put everything at stake
Well done, this is beef, right?
Jesus, holy cow, cut the bull, soul before you get meatsliced
I'm from the third, I gotta try you
Guy you play Ryu, lose a Ken in street fight[?]
You still couldn't see Lyt
Division, I got it covered, I'm so eye lit
Pilot, fly, I be the goblin
We battle for a stack, in fact they had to get a cataract cause I be the problem
But it's useless, use less filler
Excuse this, excuses, but, but, but
These asscheek niggas dead
You said you would fry Day previously
But that's what the last week nigga said
But, but, but, keep cool Joe cause a dog crazy
Get down, we turn niggas vegetable if they don't let us up
He know the heat blowers like Daffy at the casino, nigga you better duck
But I tell them tails we never tuck
We gon' line that ass up
I from the Watts block for decision
My profession is stompin' squares the fuck out
We played hopscotch for a livin'
But that's def, that's just plain old def
It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen
Have a seat, picture this, picture this photo
This a Soulo [?], hold up
Is it because he 'bout to get smoked?
Common roll the physics, so exquisite, thought I was in here dolo
No bro, somebody tell Soulo this not a solo mission
The deal closed, SoHo is it
Thought you could fuck with Me Gal? I gotta Cotto split him
Look at your girl dead in her eyes and say "Fuck Dorothy dog"
I'm toto dissin'
But at this moment, everybody in the room should be scared as Hell
As I release bars, they better bail
Objects that I process is parallel
Let's get this aligned
Minus sinus, the stuffy nose flew overhead, it's cold
Redemption, stay still, as I apply Dayquil
Cause you look like you need medical attention, don't mind me
See where mind be is a mine, explosive
Interior is inferior, this is a hobby probably
Y'all see I got the drop on everybody
That's why I reign superior
Whether you like or not, it's Hell for you, ice plate
These blister niggas still can't overshadow a nice Day, remember
You did say you would fry Day
But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets
Preacher for they peeps, you asshole
You in the motion to grab toes, you're reachin' for defeat
I tell 'em I got the foreign
Cut the sheep, it's all for the woolish
Game, I play is death, get sword for the hoodish
Actin', it's Tinactin, it's all for the footage
I'm dope, I'm practical, crack to you
I need a lot of space, the galactic crew, the actors knew
You feel it it's Felix, see what the old cat could do
But you got the roots stirred up
Gelatin dropped and slide, this game is stormchasin'
Based on whether you got the drive
Win rounds, destroy their whole city
Will they get toured? Nay, do you realize
I still got a break, brother
When I quake in action, think of Blake and Jackson
Take cover
That's Lyt work, Soul
Cut your lights switch, see how the Lyt works, Soul
I cut the light switch off and your light switch off, Soul
Somebody get this nigga help
I mean, like, Soul, assist him
Get him help, I'm sendin' this nigga out the Solar System
I mean it's simple, Aretha Franklin, you a soul sister
(That's enough, man Imma have to throw one of these masks on, man
Should I finish him off?
Use the mask, Day
I ain't done)
And I told you once, I gotta give 'em the quill
And I gotta give 'em the skill
I be on the tip like I tried to give 'em the bill
New approach, Bull coach, I tried to give 'em the Phil
For Watts, starvin', gotta get us a meal
Bein' modest, this is modern astrology for the real
You can't back up defeat but I try to get up the hill
Cold, rack up the heat but I'm tired of niggas that grill
Chicago in my blood, but I used to be the shyest
Cat form, but now I'm back searchin' for the highest
Platform, see where I come from, it was sirens
Blackboards, eyelids see the violence, what is that for?
44 shoot, they screamin', "Who's that guy?"
Jesus, his face, they screamin', "Who's that god?"
We be on the top, careers gettin' too high
They knew I would get a million dollars, what I do buy
That pink kid in the cup, that Majin Buu fly
Tragic, twin maggots, I grew up too fly
They askin, "Who I?" in front of that triangle black
That's that guy that come with the side kangol hat
We take it back from slangin' packs to the stars mission
Older now, I'm in the Rover but it's not a Mars mission
Settle down, one child, marry, feel like I'm Marge pimpin'
Bitches wanna eat my shorts, feel like I'm Bart Simpson
I feel this a full moon, chocolate, dreams puddin'
They be likin' everything I do, they're teen wolfin'
But you got it, you got it bad
2Pac, [?]
Two watches, that's pocket change
Dude coppin' that clock exchange
Credit good, I'ma pull the card out
Better be hyesterectomy, show 'em how to ball out
Cough, they can show that they're stomach so they fall out
Whip, double roof, dog barkin' in the dog house
And I gotta give 'em the Lyt
My people in the struggle, I gotta give 'em a fight
Ain't no equal piece of puzzle, hope God'll give us the mic
Ain't no sequel to this puzzle, I gotta give us the life
Wow, they say the Bugatti went up in price
Wow, that's a million
I'm done[Outro:]
Ces jours-ci, je suis très concentré


This verse was ghost written by Capital STEEZ
I’m high cause I fly with Loriana’s angel wings
Not cause I smoke weed, we in the era of the Pros
If you peepin' this your speaker Is worth 47 Karat gold, Soul
Yo, correct me if I'm lyin', you got a Hublot, but we both know
You still check your iPhone to tell the time
Only time will tell, you're atomic as my microscopic
You tryin' to spit a verse, I'm trying to crack the microcosms of the universe
It's all Mathematics!
I multiply division like I was fitted for glasses
The difference between me and you is
All you do is subtract, all my tracks sub
To sum it up that ain't adding up, I've had it up
To here with this shit I be hearin' These Days
Marvel Comics' superheroes in capes with marbles for brains
But I'm the Peter Parker in this World Wide Web
Spider senses tingling, move like I have 8 legs
I got next, cause I show them how to use their head
Rip the arms of a grizzly with my bare hands
I bet you play dead and I bet they think
That I'm delivering babies the way I bring in the bread
And I hate to address it but niggas wearin' dressses now?
Hey, it do cost a lot to live this here lifestyle
Cash money talk, bullshit walk a million miles
And I don't even write, where am I supposed to draw the line?
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd actually be Rapsody
Half of these niggas sell pussy after the
Top Dawg that mastered this craftsmanship
Ain't cop these Margielas to go back to the ave then Crip
To make you more jealous cause now we getting paid per view
Cash stacks in the plasma, that's a Pay-Per-View
And I still remember what Pac's Pop told us
"Keep your enemies close nigga, watch your homies"
And it's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, troll your insta
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya
My little sister just did molly for the first time
While I'm rolling with models, forgetting I'm a role model
Who else you know who shot across the whole nation
No MTV Jam or radio rotation
So don't ask me about Kendrick and Q
Jay Rock, Zaywop and SZA's sexy ass too
Cause I was thinking Long Term before I met them
I've been through Hell and back I deserve Heaven
And I thank all of yall who supported the 'These Days Tour'
For 47 cities there's 47 Bars
And this is the 47th bar


[Hook:]
Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffin' on a Black & Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out
Smoke til' I'm blackin' out, I know my future blacker now
All black everything, Black Hippy the regime[Verse 1:]
Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffin' on a Black & Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out
Hot box like Pacquiao packed in the steamroom
That's ain't eucalyptus you sniffin' it's weed fool
We in this mufucker thick ass high like my bitch
Gimme room like a Motel 6 or meet your doom
And tell em' this, I got more participants that think it's just a myth
Adjust your mutherfuckin' stereo
So I can drop the bomb on you and watch your fuckin' ears explode[Bridge:]
All we do is do it [x10]
(Nigga squadddd)[Verse 2:]
I'm the highest nigga at the bottom of the totem pole
And I ain't sweatin' shit man, I'm cooler than where sodas go
Fuck so and so long as Soul show up ho!
Tell do' po' up I'm finna go in (go in)
Blowin' L's not takin' L's go win
Do a nigga squad you will not survive
You ain't on this side? You are livin' lies
Put two and two together, I'm the one, high five
Mobbin' like I'm tryna catch a case
The dick make your chick jaw drop Ma catch your face
Eatin rappers on a plate like Etouffee
I do this everyday this verse is a 8th of ye'
When you look at me what do you see?
If I wasn't in Black Hippy I'd be the 4th Fugee
Unruly, seekin' redemption in light of Tookie
The game is all ours like violent movies[Bridge][Hook][Verse 3:]
Black Lip Bastard, black shades, black shirt
Puffin' on a Black & Mild, I know my lungs is blackened out
Smoke til' I'm blackin' out, I know my future blacker now
All black everything, Black Hippy the regime
Black Panther party reincarnated, y'all hate it
Niggas tryna put a hex on me like the Star of David
Everything I say is real
Got a few jewels in high places you know the deal
Fuck you niggas talkin' bout?
Your run is over like the Oprah show walk it out
They say I'm really out my mind mane
All do is get high and play mind games
This is my game I payed off the referee
Been fouled since I was born like Jeffery
The only MC with telepathy
Fuck that the only celebrity in 11-D
I swear to God it won't be long
I have Tyler lightin' bongs and recitin' Psalms
I'm an angel with' an angle what I mean well
I'm just a demon that means well[Bridge][Outro:]
Hey Ali you know what they call me?
You know what they call me Ali? Huh?
Black lip bastard
Big bitch


(It's all subjective shit)
Yeah, you know? It's like the calm before the storm
(Perception is everything)
Soulo the god and The Ichiban Don[Hook:]
Bunch of fuckin' drones
Bunch of drones, can't think for your own
Can't think for your own
Out my window all I see is Babylon, grab your gun
You ain't a knight tonight, you won't live to see the mornin' sun
Yellow tape, pistols in your face, hold on, show no weakness
Money, murder, grab your burner, cabins burnin' where it's freezing
Soulo, yeah I'm the one you heard about
Fuck's gotten into Herbert now? He's so foul it's birds around
Had it my way like it's Burger King, you don't want beef, put that burger down
Don't go against my coalition, you can kiss my colon, pow
Guess it's in my heritage, I double-cross snakes and go ape shit
Psychedelic, she left on her heels and I'm chewin' pills, I can't taste shit
My dick look like a spaceship, "Stairway to Heaven" on my playlist
On 9/11 I called 9-1-1 and the voice recording said this (Hello)[Hook]
About face
Can't think for your own
This ain't no manifesto, you niggas know me
My niggas manifest O's of the OG
High tech sippin' hi-tech like Detroit Red used to coach me
AB, see he, D-E, F the (most G)
No pen though, I just pulled this shit out the wind, bro
Ain't got shit to lose, but a win bro, it's a win, bro, this shit's simple
Gettin' dough like Papa John, your momma all on Papa John
Ain't got no chain, I ain't no slave, ain't got no watch, I ain't got the time
The SWAT team got robots and I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' mine
Literally, fuck a pair of shoes, I'm cockin' nines, dare you to shoot
Headline, Ab-Soul facin' fed time
Rewind, it wasn't 'bout that, no rat but I'm droppin' dimes
Iceberg Slim with the furnace on, I knows war, that's real talk
All my life, I knew I was ill, Rock had me on the billboard
In God I trust, I ain't no fool, no
But on the real, I just hope my credit card does too, Soul[Hook]
About face
Can't think for your own
I bought some Alexander Wang, after I heard "New Slaves"
Went and bought some Alexander Wang, after I heard "New Slaves"
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul, y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul, y'all niggas can't fuck with Soul


[Intro: Ab-Soul]
The fame
The fortune
The need to be important
Will exist as long as the Earth is in orbit[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Far from a Frankie Lymon but I'm feelin' the scrutiny
The fame
The bitches in they visions is screwin' me
Cause they don't see Soul
They see commerce
{Boy you finna be the biggest}
Get her a pre-sale ticket
I used to sit and stare at my phone and wait for rings
Like professional athletes or any wife to be
Now it's ringin' off the hook cause I wrote a tight hook
The list goes on man
I could write a book
But you know the popular sayin'
"Be careful what you wish for"
I just wanted to move people
I didn't know it'd come with this whore
Got me steppin' outside like menthols
Well sellin' your soul's the end all be all
I'm just tellin' the truth people
But you could prolly only feel me if you're involved
Just know what you in for[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Some people wonder why I wear shades at night
I say "Cause in the dark, they're still that bright."
I see my enemies
They see me too
You wish you was me like something's wrong with you
They say I'm becomin' such a household name
That everywhere I go I'm sure to feel the
{Fame}
Some people wonder why I wear shades at night[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Tell me how you supposed to feel when you walk in a room
Everybody swellin' your head 'til it's as big as the room
You still ain't made it
But it appears to be comin' true
At a time you tryna find what the world is comin' to
And don't forget about your family
You would think it was all love
They waitin' for you to fuck up to blame it on your moms
Like "She did a horrible job
He don't look too good in the eyes of God."
But you know the popular sayin' "Be careful what you wish for."
It just might happen
I never thought I'd make it this far
When I was young I used to wanna ball like Chris Paul
Hoop dreams converted to writin' hit songs
To some of y'all it's just rappin'
And I wrote this over the toilet cause I was pissed off
No shit...[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Some people wonder why I wear shades at night
I say "Cause in the dark, they're still that bright."
I see my enemies
They see me too
You wish you was me like something's wrong with you
They say I'm becomin' such a household name
That everywhere I go I'm sure to feel the
{Fame}
Some people wonder why I wear shades at night[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
The fame
The fortune
The need to feel important
Will exist as long as the Earth is in orbit
Michael Jackson died just a few days ago
Some people say "Malpractice"
But just imagine
Sellin' a hundred million plus copies off of one project
Grown men fallin' out just to touch your fashion
You become an object
With or without an objective of your very own
That type of attention can drive a man mad
So be careful what you wish for
This music is what I do
'Til I die it's what I live for
So if you do it for the jewels
Or the new tennis shoes
And not to be mentioned with Pac, Biggie, and Nas
Then you do it to pollute
I'm Captain Planet with my pants saggin'
Tell the truth
Rewrite it, define it, and spell it too
Make sure you shake every hand
And take a picture with every fan
And do whatever you can do[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
The fame'll consume you
The fame'll confuse you
Make it look like everything is an optical illusion
The fame will haunt you
Listen what I taught you
Even on your day off
The fame is on you
The fame ain't expensive
But the fame will cost you
The fame is your friend
But the fame will cross you
Take what I say as a warning
Precaution
From the captain blockin' moonlight with my sunglasses
Bastards...[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Yeah
Yeah
Be careful what you wish for
It just might happen...
They say I'm becomin' such a household name
I'm tryna feel the...
Some people wonder why I wear shades at night...


Yo, yo. Truly on point naturally on task creating history everyday and my name's Ab Dash Soul motherfucker at last add a set of Jays classic as a Cadillac record played? Me never that. Act like you know. Don't get rammed shacked by the rat pack see I'm the black Humfrey Bogart puffed in black stone hella smart ass hole see this my culinary art how I cook up such food for thought clear the kitchen it's finna get hot uh master chef no account to cash your check you niggas ain't half of half of half my best uh champagne wishes some green in my swishers a Nicki Minaj with two 5 star bitches Ladies and gentlemen this is a look inside the mind of the demented and everything I said I swear I meant It listen fascinated by the tactics of a Jeffery Daumer eat your ass up a cannibal for the dollar it's tangible I'm off the top rhyming noodles that's understandable The last Samurai here to tear a guy apart tie a piece of barbed wire around his heart if he's gased up he gets bowah constricted until he farts if he talks and it don't correspond to his walk he walks the plank Captain Hook went hard Peter was gay you'll never never land a spot on our roster that way not a rasta but I smoke like a wailer they know In serving niggas tip the waiter before you leave the table God dammit just found another crack up in my halo are you comprehending am I condescending or am I kindly sending you a message kind of quickly I never get to busy to get busy simply stunning your Mrs. can't miss me engine gunning headed for the finish line but not the sneaker store I need that first place prize the blue ribbon in the ski I'm Stevie wonder getting high What you even speaking for you're iller when mute is on carry on ha-ha And I ain"t gotta talk that white to bury ya'll the truth will set you free and me I'm whip and chain free Literally no car no jewelry just a brain full of buffoonery between you and me


[Ab-Soul:]
My back against the wall, I can see y'all fronting
Drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing
I call this shit "Rapper Shit" cause I ain't a rapper
But if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after
Caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor
You're lame, paving away, Bob the Buil' factor
I'm a real master, real massive, you just real average
I see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage
And it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
Don't act like you knew my tactics
Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last
I see through your true colors like stained glass
I see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
And what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
When every time a nigga open a door you go inside
Just to realize, either you're weak or someone lied
See, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
So by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo
And who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
Would slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab
Ab-Soul, Abstract Asshole
Black Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever
I follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure
But whatever[Kendrick Lamar:]
They say pressure bust pipes
And I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
Sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
Or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
You would test me but you know better
It's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth
Of the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar
But my mind is like a wizard
I defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence
Back teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom
I have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, scorch ya
Third degree burns next to their sideburns, all sorts of
Combustible flows, firemen on speed dial
Free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
Free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
And feed off my feelings as I control my wheel
Like new power steering, so sincere
Tryna duck court hearings but I got big ears
Rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
Now they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them
Reluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em
They say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas
So when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
And watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
I got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
Give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
I am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
Big homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck
Dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
Put me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun/son still shine
Still got a skill to be found in a gold mine[Ab-Soul:]
I got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic
Who with pliers couldn't get a grip on life
I spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and that's intense
Imagine if I had already came twice, ain't that some shit
Pass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga
Fly your kite till you're gone till November nigga
Show 'em you remember nigga
Pour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground
Smoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down
Like the triangle in the panties of my gal
When Mike Jack made "Raining in Moscow" I had no style
Tommy Boy stocking on my scalp
And that was like ninety-five, now it's twenty-ten
Two years away from when they say the world's expected to end
And I ain't even begin
That's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from "Many Men", one[Kendrick Lamar:]
Too many relays for DJs to replay
I do the reject while I eject your new singlay
Hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
Piss on a demon with ice water
And if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A
Systems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread
Like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
And that's off top like a toupee, I'm 2Pac
Coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
Get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
I influence ghettos where it says caution
And them larkins get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling
Round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
We racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
And nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
Y'all work at Build-A-Bear's office, underhand pitching with skills[Ab-Soul:]
Shit, and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk
You're dead and gone
The pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on
And on the real, this ain't a construction site but you know the drill
We lead the league in all aspects
And we deserve more medals/metals than a magnet
Put you niggas in a hole like bad debt
Shooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga, nothing but the best
Every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
I rhyme like a fucking TEC
-9, and I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect
You looking at T-Rex snapping at a winter rest
Yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
Too late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers
Some shit only BIG and Pac could rap after
And if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
I am God
M.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yo, check – my flow is unknown to man yet
Damnit – keep runnin’ ’round like an annual banquet
Made a withdrawal with your broad, she left the bank wet
Rub her like a condom, contemplating dangerous sex
I’m unimpressed with your talent, skills still appeal
A maestro on the mic, though, I’m almost as ill as Camille, for real
Ain’t never runnin’ from nothin’, I’m fit to tread mills
Name another movement making time stand still…
High-powered to the third degree
Murder, we emerged, and it was an emergency
It’s closed curtains for you worthless earthlings
Hurtin’ ’cause I rise like mercury in the burning heat
Words on the streets, Solo done done it again
Look at me, I used to match a dub sack with my friends
Now we smokin’ by the O, like the letters P and N
Ain’t have to start watching CNN for you to see an end
It’s coming quicker than you think, don’t mean to rub it in
Like Lubriderm, but you should learn that you could never fuck with him
Abs gettin’ bigger, but I ain’t do no sit-ups
Got the hiccups, ’cause I keep puffin’ ‘Ports without the filter
Feel the vibe switch in every single room that I enter
Told my bitch to make room for a tomb for her placenta, nigga
I’ll fuck her ’til she have a seizure in my leisure time
She know I love her, also know I don’t need her
‘Cause I’m a king, and I smoke a lot of weed
That makes sense, it’s about 33 ounces in a litre
In layman’s terms, you lames had better pay respect
Or you’ll be sleepin’, they’ll be at your wake, payin’ their respects[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Said it’s the soul cold wickedness – old folk killin’ shit
Most Dope syndicate, the Go Pro’s filming it
Good coke, sniffin’ shit – broke, no benefits
Smack him in his face and then I’m blowin’ smoke into it
Obliterated on a big estate, shit…
I figure fame is just a bitch’s game
That’s why there’s raindrops drippin’ off my windowpane
And I was gettin’ money far before the fiscal game
Official names, got plugs like a new strain does
You may be hot inside your city, but homie you ain’t us
You can’t trust nothin’ if it’s comin’ with a dollar sign
It’s genius coming from out of my awkward mind
Cross the line? It’s just not the time
And he ain’t thinkin’, put that red dot on his mind
I’m Satana’s bandana, against me, you don’t stand a chance
Call you fancy pants, ’cause when you drunk, you do the hammer dance
If there’s a random chance you fuckin’ up my Phantom plans
I’mma go bananas and blam ‘em until the ambulance
My mother’s sonogram was like a mission statement
‘Cause I wasn’t patient, left that pussy in a spaceship
Y’all fools basic, your parents both racist
I’m lawyering these hoes out here, beating cases
She eatin’ dick, so she plead the Fifth
Yeah, it’s Larry Fish, homie, he’s a myth
You sunk my battleship, I be in Nazareth ’bout where Jesus lived
And your homie with you, he’s a bitch, some vagina shit
Gettin’ faded, go sing in Vegas
I’m just observing, a man of different faces
Yup, some dick licker want my kids in her
She a switch hitter, told her bring a bitch with her
The dick split her like a Swisher then I’m outtie… outtie
I never eat the pussy if it’s lousy… lousy
I’m the prodigal son, the ominous Nostradamus
Anonymous visions, confidant, some Obama shit
In moccasins, takin’ Annie… alright…


I wake up every morning to text messages
From foreigners saying they love me, they miss me
They want me, are you in town?
When are you coming over, are you around?
How’s life treating you? Are you holding it down?
Can you wear my T-shirt? Can you come to my store?
How much for a verse from Kendrick Lamar?
Is Q really from Hoover? Is Rock still signed to Tech N9ne?
And this is just when I rise, imagine my whole day
My momma smiling more than ever, man and it’s so strange
It’s what I asked for though, I can’t complain
I wanna say “I told you so” but that won’t change a thing I’m afraid
I paid my little sister’s rent last month, man, that was great
My grandpa thought I wouldn’t graduate
Now I’m selling out shows and he’s stoked and shows all in his face
I even put my step pops in his place, for questioning my objective in this place
I don’t blame him, I’m just saying, always knew I was the man
I owe nothing to no one, except those who told me I was the one
When lowkey I wasn’t, that was what I was becoming
Now I’m buzzing and everybody my cousin, that’s phony
Y’all don’t know me, where was y’all when I was lonely?
A pack of Black and Milds every twenty four hours
Skipping showers ‘cause I felt dirty, unworthy of power
Though I never cursed the Lord, but I questioned his motives
I still do, except now, I’m exceptionally focused
However the road ends, I’m rolling, say amen
You foes won’t stop me or succeed like I can
I see snakes, the grass must be cut, is it Wednesday?
And I’m happy especially nip it at the bud now
And what is happening exactly? I’m sick of the smoke signals
Like a green cross in a dispensary window
Unit 6 woulda been dope but the industry wouldn’t let it
Creativity don’t tend to mix with business endeavors
Whatever though, you know the anthem is get money and some
Become a legend and leave a legacy for your grandson
I told Lani I’mma do it, and I did it, hope she forgive me when she hear me saying shit like
“G’s up nigga, hoes down, if the bitch can't swim, then she gon’ drown in it”
You know I stay on my humble but these days ain’t fuckin’ with me (ain’t fuckin’ with me)
I go from Carson to Harlem, I hold it down, how couldn’t you see? (how couldn’t you see?)
You know I’m here for the long term, it’s my turn, pull up a seat (pull up a seat)
Go ahead and light up the smoke and throw up your hands and wave with me
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Pour up your drink and wave with me
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Where’s Max B when you need him?
Where’s Max B when you need him?
This is the new wave now jump in the sea[Max B:]
Ay yo, y’all niggas stay wavy man, I love y’all man
Keep the wave goin’ I told y’all I was gonna leave y’all with that wave
About 500 out there in the [?] county
Man y’all stay strong, I’m still staying strong, I’m focused
I’m on my way back, prophecy will be fulfilled
It’s wavy for life, don’t forget it I’m still wavy
Oww, Oww


[Hook - Aloe Blacc:]
I'm gonna get in my car
But wherever I go
Seems like trouble will find me
And I don't want trouble to find me
I admit I play hide and seek with the violence
String theories together just like a violin
Red roses, blue violets
The top pick in the cockpit
That's fly shit
Like defecating on a private plane, it's simple
G4 with it, women with me
In the present, here's a test
If you tour the future then the past represents death
Life, will it take me under? I don't know
The good die young and the ugly get dough
I feel this prickly feeling on the back of my neck
The reaper tippy toe behind me everywhere that I go
That's why I ride slow, I used to be in a rush
Fast life, slow motion
These days, I'm so focused
And as soon as the chauffeur hold this door open I'ma[Hook]
Here's a tiny tip
There's no escapin' the trouble that come with this grand hustle
You willin' to give everything for the glistenin' wrists
Findin' the right fabric to keep your family knit
Vanity slave, runnin' red lights, smokin' weed, they in love with you
When you're untouchable, sonny
You was born to fuckin' die, 'til then get money
The belly of the beast ain't no tummy, you mistaken
Track record longer than a train station
You just record tracks, what a waste of wax
Name an individual exempt
From a candlelight vigil and bring me his head
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Optimistic but they say I need an ophthalmologist
Now they just look at me like they owe me apologies
So many red eyes I might need Visine
Audio pilot, that's why I'm so high up
The trouble still finds us like a citation, that's why I'm hatin'
The waitin' and silent conversation with God like
Why the Hell is Heaven so far?
Don't need a stairway, I need a rocketship to blast off
So what? No buts, I work my ass off
And all my champions comply
It's do or die when I ride, Tracy Chapman didn't die, nah[Aloe Blacc x2:]
I'm gonna get in my car, I'm gonna drive real fast
But wherever I go
Seems like trouble will find me
And I don't want trouble to find me[Aloe Blacc:]
No more, no more, no more
I don't want trouble to find me no more
Said I don't want trouble to find me no more
I don't want trouble to find me no more
No more, no more, no more, no more


More than a man, I been died and rose again, yeah
Fast life, slow motion - {These Days}[sample of Jackson Browne's "These Days" (Ab-Soul):]
Well I've been out walking 
I don't do that much talking {These Days} (I gotta stop smokin' cigarettes)
{These Daaaaays} (yep)
{These Days} I seem to think a lot
about the things that I forgot to doooo, for you (man)
And all the times I had the chance to
(Yo, how the fuck my new girl got me jealous of other girls?)
(I think I live in another world) And I had a lover (fuck!)
But it's so hard to risk another {These Days} (These Days)
{These Daaaaays}
(Ay, he wrote this shit when he was 16 he said)
(This is, I'm 27, this is like my whole life)
Now if I seem to be afraid (like this second, yeah)
To live the life, that I have made in sooooong
(You know all I like to do is keep it real - Soulo, hoe)
Well it's just that I have been losing, soooooo long
(Can I win one time? Yeah, yeah this that pain you was talkin' about)
(Can I win one time? Uh, uh)
So many pills I should have slipped already (yeah)
My lungs the same color as my lips already (yeah)
Expensive clothes and sufficient funds
Me and my bros switchin' hoes just for fun (yeah)
The money and bitches is all we care about
Very far from home if you worried about my whereabouts
Chasin' the light at the end of the fuckin' tunnel
Pray for Sydney, send Tia a text, tell her I love you (I love you)
The devil is a lie, never let him persevere
God took my angel and left me here, it's Heaven here[sample of Jackson Browne's "These Days" (Ab-Soul):]
Well I'll keep on moving, moving on (yeah)
Things are bound to be improving {These Days} (it's Longterm, this shit real)
I love These Daaaaays (it'll all make sense one day, my nigga)
(I've even been on songs with Common, it's crazy)
{These Days} I'll sit on corner stones (can't stop me my nigga, yeah)
And count the time in quarter tones to teeeen, my friend (uh, yeah)
Don't confront me with my failures (can't achieve success without failure, baby!)
I have not forgotten them
Diggin' for gold in these codeine bottles
Trying to picture potential in these Instagram models (like)
Information racing around the Internet
Before the iPad was invented, I had a pad of writtens
Smokin' a cig on the side of the house tryin' to figure it out
The axe didn't cut it, moms told me cut it out
Clem told me always take pride in my work
I clutch the mic with blessed hands at all my concerts
Why his name Soulo? How is he so smart?
We can see his four footprints in the sand when he walk (Black Lip Bastard)
I like to refer to myself in third person from the third person (3's)
That's a out-of-body experience of self (yeah)
So I can see me for me and no one else
Don't need to see a Emmy, award or no jail (Soul)
I'm at them like a cell, I just want to be free
All this chatter from the chattel nigga, I don't speak sheep (yeah)
This TDE and nothin' beyond that (infinite)
Told Du-Dog I don't even need to read the contract (hahaha)
Yeah, as if some legal documents can stop me
Legalize, legal lies, legal eyes so I see
I did it while you were sitting wishin', ask my nigga DZA
All my verses hearses leavin' {Church's}, not the cheap chicken (yeah!)
And I love the beast coast but what about the best one?
What's your life without a soul? A dead one
(Yeah Mac, you ain't got bars like that Mac!)


Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls,
More girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls

Nice ass, nice tits, nice legs, nice hips
Wish I could take you home and strip you butt naked
Then put you in a cage and feed you grapes all day long
I’m a dreamer please forgive me baby
I’m just so determinated
To get you to demonstrate
What you do with the men you dated
And me against the wall, and give you all

The search has begun, this is page one. 
Man, meet your maker, I give you The Author. 
He may seem familiar because he looks like your mirror. 
You've lied like a lawyer, but don't deny it when you're face to face 
with demons dancing off mirror images reflecting all that you wanted. 
So far from perfect, onward we will strive.
Take it for what it's worth, this truth that you've realized.
You're not who you thought you were, it's time to see the other side of what you have become. 
Nothing but your single serving selfish chapters of sacrificial moral standards.
No stranger to apathy in bold situations, take your time to make it happen. 
Leave your mirror, and spare your excuse as a self-serving actor.
So close to perfect. 
It's all the same, no face or complexion. 
You're not worth what you're spending. 
When you're screaming "Danger, Danger!", don't stop, go on alone. 
Desperate endeavor, you've got to take it or leave it, if you will. 
It's not so convincing that you're the only one here who can be like me.
The search has begun. Leave your letters, but it won't matter. 
Take back what is left before your death, but is it really you that they suspect?
You take shots, who's the figure before the flame? 
It's not hard to spark, but it's hard to master.  So look for the answer. 
Single serving selfish chapters on your condition.  Lust and liars. 
So get out, stop dreaming, if you're one for breathing. 
Sacrificial moral standards of two reflections. 
Truth and fire, something you'll live for. 
So close to perfect. 
It's all you've got, one chance for conviction. 
Lies fuel fires and your suspect won’t walk. 
When you're screaming "Danger, danger!" 
Don't, don’t stop, just go on alone. 
Desperate endeavor, you’ve got to take it or leave it if you will. (run, run)
It's not so convincing that you're the only one who could be like me. 
From this point on. 
The way you thought it would all work out... 
But we've hit Autumn. 
Just follow the story, the fall of The Author. 
Just one more year and you'll choose to regret.
One on one to repent, your eyes are fading. 
Sleep alone, sleep alone, sleep alone.
Sleep alone.


Take, take these words in. Take them like you did that foreign excitement. You bleed lust. Choke. So was it worth it? Did you get what you wanted, the silent type. Did you even come close, did they let you taste it? I can see how the rush, and the heat, and the touch of a stranger gets you going. You're feeling selfish, you've got the urge.  Don't bother keeping your heavy breathing down for the one who can't hear you scream.
Never pass of your guilt lines, just wear them like a noose on your neck, I'll help you keep it tied tight. When you feel your close to coming, just think about that perfect subtle demon that you've been dreaming into the light, keep it tied tight.
Unlike the way you've become "city feature", you'd love to let them rip you apart until you feel clean, but when it's over he won't take back what is left. I can see how the speed, and the sting, and the wings of the plane home make you nervous.  Oh, Mr. Shoddy Content, swept all your dignity under the covers, she'll be lying, keeping secrets, keeping quiet. Now you understand what it's like to dive. Take it back, taken back, she forgets you. Now she pleads "Forgive me again, it's the last time I will..."
Never pass of your guilt lines, just wear them like a noose on your neck, I'll help you keep it tied tight. You're the worst actor that I've ever seen but if this script called for liars, you'd play the lead.  "When you've changed, I'll change" what it's like again.  What you don't see while you sleep...3 year deceiver, you're not fooling.
Never pass of your guilt lines, just wear them like a noose on your neck, I'll help you keep it tied tight. You're the worst actor that I've ever seen but if this script called for liars, you'd play the lead.


Forced to the wall, 
the crosshairs shift from this tied down burden: Courage.
What did you expect? 
A nightmare of reason and faith alike. 
Because you take shots, my back's turned, you're gutless. 
You think you're saving face 
But I'll tell you what (I‘ll tell you what) 
As far as you're concerned the next breath that you take should be underwater. 
You're worthless. You've been told once before. 
This time you're gonna get back a little more than you paid for.
Forced to the wall the record skips and this satellite sense is detecting.
You run for cover. A nightmare, a vision, a quota, a reason. 
You take shots, my back's turned, you're gutless. 
You think you're saving face but first things first, 
this is a matter of egos and how every single shot you take 
Is taken in weakness and vain. 
Place your bets, it's a matter of context.
You said it, you mean it, you want it, you've got it. 
I've been waiting far too long for this. 
You take shots, my back's turned, you're gutless, and you've got no spine at all. 
I've been waiting. Take your shot and be on your way. 
Spill fiction while my back is turned, when you've got an easy target. 
Build stregth, and your heart is gone. 
You tell my back that you're more courageous. 
We've got our souls held in this dark hotel room.
You're taking chances for the worst and the worst is yet to come.
Place your bets, it's a matter of…
You said it, you mean it, you want it, you've got it. 
I've been waiting far too long for…
Show a litte backbone. 
In this hole we've dug, you're never crawling out alive. 
You won't make it too far, you won't get too far. 
In this home we've made, you're never welcome again. 
You wont make it too far.
 Place your bets son, pay your ransom. 
You don't know what it is to regret.


Get out of the city if it hurts. You're too blind, move it over, try to get closer to the lifestyles of gluttons; seem so seamless and perfect. I've been the secret that you've been keeping.
Ears to the wall, eyes on the prize. See that you've made a mistake, and we all know what you've done here. Dear Interceptor, I've been waiting... Show me something. Hold the phone, we've found an answer. Full moons and minot keys to get there faster. Mirror, mirror, see this as clear as crystalline. Second-hand interpreter. The spoken word for change.
Wait for me, I wanted to feel this safe. I can't hear you scream. Hold the phone to make it better, I can't hear you.
Blood to the beat. This thirst of the Lion can't be quenched by cigarette strewn cubicle air. Dear diluted, while you're dreaming... Hold the phone, we've found an answer. Full moons and minot keys to get there faster. Mirror, mirror, see this as clear as crystalline. Second-hand interpreter, deep into the Red we need a change.
Just look at this cardboard cut-out, this puppet that you've become. Let me be the first to acknowledge you've no pride, you've no purpose. It's so typical to think less is more when you're out of the lead. Don't hurt yourself. Settle for less. It's so typical to think less is more when you're out of the lead. Second-hand interpreter, the spoken word for change.
Wait for me. I can't hear you. Hold the phone, we've found an answer.


Case is closed, you're back into focus. 
The jury's out, you're closing in. 
This battle of mind over matter's spent. 
This scar. This scar is not permanent. 
Choices of chances, or what sinks in water. 
Your secret's out, what you held within. 
You've found your plague, your cancer, stop. 
I bet you've got something clever.
This house is caving in. Your last words, caught trembling. 
Decisions, make decisions for your fate. 
Your choice is the chance that you have to take. 
Burn, stop. Your time is up. You've found all of the answers 
so take a breath and end this chapter, 
I'll bring the fire if you bring the water.
(Face, face) Face to the grave, will the hero be saved? 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life. 
(Hey, hey) Hero be safe from the killer you made. 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life.
Case is closed, you're back into focus. 
The jury's out, you're closing in. 
This battle of mind over matter's spent. This scar. This scar... 
Rising the Judge screams "The courtroom is in order! 
You bring the victim and we choose the martyr!" 
Taking the time to make it hurt, I can't hear you scream.
This house is caving in. Your last words, caught trembling. 
Decisions, make decisions for your fate. 
Your choice is the chance that you have to take. 
Burn, stop. Your time is up. You've found all of the answers 
so take a breath and end this chapter, 
I'll bring the fire if you bring the water.
(Face, face) Face to the grave, will the hero be saved? 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life. 
(Hey, hey) Hero be safe from the killer you made. 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life.
From this point on, hear no evil, speak non-tongues 
in the rhythms of past lovers, come together or not at all
From this point on, hear no evil, speak non-tongues 
in the riddles told by older ones
(Burn quick, sink slow.)
Burn quick, sink slow. Your heart grows colder than regret. (colder than regret)
Your burden stone. Your heart grows colder, still beat, weak and frozen. 
(Face, face) Face to the grave, will the hero be saved? 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life. 
(Hey, hey) Hero be safe from the killer you made. 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life.
(Face, face) Face to the grave, will the hero be saved? 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life. 
(Hey, hey) Hero be safe (safe, safe) from the killer you made. 
Saved by the same hands, the same hands that frame life.


Attention! Attention! 
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room,
if only, if only for one second.
This table has taken a turn for the worst.
Rock bottom and over the edge
well it's not like it hurts that much anyway.
Upside down and inside out.
When I leave here I'm going alone.
Well it's not like, it not like it hurts much anyway.
Attention! Attention! 
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room,
if only, if only for one second.
Will you hear what I have to say?
Oh, did I mention when I see you it stings like hell?
To the fact that we could have something that'll never happen.
Will you hear what I have to?
This balance has weighed out our heart's desire.
I'm trying to make it alone.
Well it's not like it hurts that much anyway.
Upside down and inside out.
When I leave here I'm going alone.
But I'm dying, I'm dying to touch.
And it's not like, it not like it hurts much anyway.
Attention! Attention! 
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room,
if only, if only for one second.
Will you hear what I have to say?
Oh, did I mention when I see you it stings like hell?
To the fact that we could have something, something.
Attention! Attention! 
May I have all your eyes and ears to the front of the room,

Oh, did I mention when I see you it stings like hell?
To the fact that we could have something that'll never happen.
Will you hear what I have to (say)?

Attention! Attention!
Upside down and inside out.[Note: there is a (demo?) version of this song where
first stanza is the complete chorus with words
"Will you hear what I have to say?
Oh, did I mention when I see you it stings like hell?
To the fact that we could have something that'll never happen"]


Wake up, think fast, three weeks have passed. 
We are changing. No sleep, no gas, no excuses will pass these lips
Cause we're shapin' up to be all you wish you could have been 
To write the hits and to turn their heads 
And to open eyes (open your eyes) to a brand new season, 
A brand new season. 
So show me something we haven't heard yet, 
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick. 
But I, I'll sing you something you won't forget 
For the first time I know this is now who I am.

You'll see what we mean,
You'll notice when we're gone.
So show me something we haven't heard yet,

Close the door and take the stairs. 
Up or down? Ups and downs.
Don't pretend you've never been there. 
You kiss me like an overdramatic actor who's starving for work, 
with one last shot to make it happen.
You've won the role, you've played your part, you've been cordially invited. 
But I'm not impressed, and I'm definitely not excited.
'Cause the film runs a shallow budget, and the writer's subject script isn't any deeper. 
So dive right in... 
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding? 
I'm not like them. I won't buy in. 
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding? 
Don't quit 'til 47.
Then we'll turn it up and we'll play a little faster.[Chorus:]
Take back everything you ever said.
You never meant a word of it. You never did. 
Take back everything you said.
You never meant a word of it. You never did. 
She said 'Alright, Alright, slow down!" 
Oh no, oh no, we won't.
'Cause I regret every thing that I said
To ever make her feel like she was something special,
Or that she ever really mattered. 
Or did she ever really matter? 
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding? 
I'm not like them. I won't buy in. 
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
just don't count on this summer. 
Don't quit 'til 47.
Then we'll turn it up and we'll play a little faster. [Chorus] 
I'm not saying that I'm not breaking some hearts tonight, girl.
Oh...
I'm not saying that I'm not breaking some hearts tonight, girl. 
Alright, alright, slow down...[Chorus] 
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills,
hey you, who are you kidding? 
I'm not like them. I won't buy in.[x3 to fade]


My eyes can't believe what they have seen.
In the corner of your room you've stockpiled millions of my memories.
Oh Doctor, Doctor, I must have gotten this sick somehow.
I'm going to ask you a series of questions,
And I want them answered on the spot, right now.
Is it serious?
I'm afraid it is.
Am I gonna die?
Well son, death is gonna catch up to all one day,
But yours is coming quicker than ours, than ours.
Some things I may have taken for granted again and again, 
well here's what was said then
Hold your head high heavy heart.
So take a chance and make it big, 
Cause it’s the last you’ll ever get.
If we don’t take it, when will we make it?
I make plans to break plans,
And I’ve been planning something big, planning something big, planning.
I’ve never tried to make the best of my time,
When I thought that I had plenty of it.
Is this serious?
I don’t know what to think.
Is it all a lie?
Well one thing is for sure
I'm taken back to the glory days
When we were kids without a brash or bitter thing to say.
Now my life is one big make it, or break it.
Hold your head high heavy heart
Save your strength for the morning after.
So take a chance and make it big, 
Cause it’s the last you’ll ever get.
If we don’t take it, when will we make it?
I make plans to break plans,
And I’ve been planning something big, planning something big
So take a chance and make it big, 
Cause it’s the last you’ll ever get.
If we don’t take it, when will we make it?
I make plans to break plans,
And I’ve been planning something big, planning something big, planning.[x2]


we've got one chance to break out 
and we need it now
cause i'm sick and tired of waiting 
sick of this fucking apartment
love me or leave me or rip me apart 
this is the voice that i was given and 
if you don't like it take a long walk 
off of the shortest pier you can find
and i'll be singing it out i'll be singing...
oh, Mr. Magazine i never wrote one single thing for you 
or your so-called music scene
you don't mean a thing to me
pick it up, pick it up, it's what you wanted.
pick it up, pick it up, and you need it too. 
pick it up, pick it up, it's what you wanted.
pick it up, pick it up.
when they review the debut 
what if the critics hate you 
don't worry cause they 
might just catch somebody off their feet
well they can love it or leave it or rip it apart
we're living while we're singing 
so i guess that's a step in the right direction
clever composition in the honesty, honesty
oh, Mr. Magazine 
i never wrote one single thing for you 
or your so-called music scene
you both mean shit to me
pick it up, pick it up, it's what you wanted.
pick it up, pick it up, and you need it too. 
pick it up, pick it up, it's what you wanted.
pick it up, pick it up.
so save your breath and the money you spent 
go work in retail and spare the suspense 
just don't take chances on anything at all
anything at all
so afraid of anything that may not come that easy
too afraid of anything that you may not have seen before
so afraid of anything that may not come that easy
too afraid of anything that may not...
pick it up, pick it up, it's what you wanted.
pick it up, pick it up, and you need it too. 
pick it up, pick it up, it's what you wanted.
pick it up, pick it up.
so save your breath and the money you spent 
go work in retail and spare the suspense 
just don't take chances on anything at all
anything at all


Don't be so scared, we will not lead you on like you've been doing for weeks. 
So you're selfish, and I'm sorry. 
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast
Nowhere fast, nowhere fast.[Chorus:]
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you, 
'cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me. 
And near death, last breath, and barely hanging on. 
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you? 
Don't be so scared to take a second for reflection, 
to take a leave of absence, see what you're made of. 
So I'm selfish, and you're sorry. 
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast. 
So who's selfish, and who's sorry? [Chorus]
Someone, somewhere said some things that may have sparked some sympathy, but don't believe. 
Don't believe a word you've heard about me. 
Don't be so scared. It's harder for me. 
Don't be so scared.
Don't be so scared, It's harder for me.
Don't be so scared, It's harder for me.
Don't be so scared, It's harder for me.
Don't be so scared.[Chorus] 
Someone, somewhere said some things that may have sparked some sympathy, but don't believe. 
Don't believe a word you've heard.
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you
Wouldn't believe you now[x2]


My life reads like the classifieds.
Pages of what's for sale; what's on the auction block.
Attention bidders! It's Lot 45.
He's got a decent voice, he's got that crooked smile.
Hold on, you haven't heard the best yet.
He writes good storylines, he's got those honest eyes.
So take him home for just $9.95.
He'll sing the songs you like, he'll keep you warm at night.
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya.
Break down and back out, and get what's coming to you.
When you said you were falling apart 
I thought you meant that you were falling apart.
I'm not the type to forget about nights like this,
when every single move that I make is documented and scored for style points.
The once ambitious one now holds the smoking gun.
And if I die in my sleep, are you still willing to be everything you promised you would be?
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya.
Break down and back out, and get what's coming to you.
When you said you were falling apart 
I thought you meant that you were falling apart.
Will you be the first one to tell the neighborhood paper
and all my family and friends that still care?
Did you buy what I sold and did you feel what I told you?
I hope that you still do. Will you promise yourself, that this isn't all we've got?
Back down, cash out, that's the city for ya.
Break down and back out, and get what's coming to you.
When you said you were falling apart 
I thought you meant that you were falling apart.[x2]


So there you are, and here I stand,
As far as I remember you weren't half bad.
Your bedroom behavior was never more than checkmarks on bedposts.
For I remember we never had.[Pre-Chorus:]
You get me out of the rain, you get me out of my clothes.
You hope I don't make a sound, you hope that nobody knows.
You get me out of the rain, you get me out of my clothes.
You hope I don't make a sound, you hope that no one...[Chorus:]
So suck your so called pity down.
Hey, that's not so bad, is it?
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
and don't forget to take deep breaths.
So suck your so called pity down.
Hey, that's not so bad, is it?
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
and don't forget to take deep breaths.
So don't explain cause I know exactly what your going to say.
Big words, recycled phrases, and the bittersweet taste of other boys on your lips.
So now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all. 
So now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all. [Prechorus][Chorus]
Do you miss looking up from the floor at my face on a stage in a crowded room? 
Well it's not the same. 
I bet you're still a sucker for those famous faces. 
Downtown, looking down, down, looking over the crowd, I hope you're out there, look at me now. 
Well it's not the same. 
Just look at how we've changed.[Chorus]


Out of the box, out of the kitchen.
Out of the world she's grown so fearful of, so fearful of.
I don't ever want to see you again.
I don't ever want to see you again.
I don't ever want to see you again.
I don't ever want to see you again, my friend.
This is the end.
Out of the house, she grabs the keys, runs for the hills and doesn't leave a letter.
That way the impact will be much better.
Away from the man that she's grown so fearful of, so fearful of.
I don't ever want to see you again.
I don't ever want to see you again.
I don't ever want to see you again.
I don't ever want to see you again.
Why, oh why, do you wear sunglasses in the home 
when the sun went down about an hour ago?
Why, oh why, do you wear sunglasses in the home 
when the sun went down about an hour ago?
Life should not be that way.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces.
Now that I'm grown I've seen marriages fall to pieces.
Now that I'm grown I've seen friendships fall to pieces.
Weekend warriors, and our best friends.
The writers weren't kidding about how all good things must end.
Then again some things, then again some things are far too good,
Some things are far too good to go ahead and let go.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
We won't forget Tony or Johnny, oh, oh.
No matter how they miss us they still wish us the best on the road.
Garrett took a plane to Paris, France.
Now he's cooking up entrees for the pretty, pretty French girls.
Bookends, Blue and Clarity, to The Wall and Grace.
Darkside, Wish and a toast to the late Figure 8.
Weekend warriors and our best friends.
The writers weren't kidding, but the good things will live in our hearts.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Always up or down, never down and out.
Dream of demons while you sleep that make you stutter when you speak.
Speak now or forever hold your peace in pieces.


So listen up.
I worked in daylight feeding fashion to housewives.
For just this once, I'll take my chances on truck stops and state lines.
Go ahead and tell them again.
Well I think that I know that they won't remember.
Go ahead and tell them twice.
Yeah, twice is nice, but three times is just right.
Hey, hey now we're almost home.
I'm missing you to death, but it's all for the best, I know.
Hey, hey we're not far from home.
I've got my pride, and I'll let you sleep tonight.
So listen up.
My old friends have been dropping like houseflies.
The smoking gun still sits in my pocket and I know how to use it.
Go ahead and tell them again.
Well I think that I know that I won't forgive them
for turning their backs when we started to get busy.
Well, yeah twice is fine, but three times is just right.
Hey, hey now we're almost home.
I'm missing you to death, but to each his own.
Hey, hey we're not far from home.
I've got my pride, and I'll let you sleep tonight.
Hey, hey now we're almost home.
I'm missing you to death, missing you to death.
Hey, hey we're not far from home.
I'll swallow my pride and push back my seat tonight.
I'm on my feet 
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet (This isn't like us anyway.)
I'm on my feet (This isn't like us anyway.)
I'm on my feet (This isn't like us anyway.)
I'm running...
Our time is almost... our time is almost here
Our time is almost... our time is almost here
Our time is almost... our time is almost here
Our time is almost... our time is almost here
Our time is almost... our time is almost here
Our time is almost... our time is almost here
Our time is almost... our time is almost here


Pour yourself a drink girl, then make one for me. 
We haven't even met yet, and I'm already sure that we won't. 
..and I'm right back where I started. 
The air in here is shaking every single nerve. 
I'm trying hard to let go, but my heart, it won't let me love you. 
..and I'm right back where I started. Right back... 
Moving on up. We're walking on the edge. 
Everyone here has demons in their past 
Now move it on up. You're walking on the edge. 
Everyone here has demons in their past now. 
The only thing worse for you than you is me. 
The only thing worse for you than you is me. 
The life that I've chosen to live will take your heart and swallow it 
The only thing worse for you than you is to make you wait for me. 
And that's why we will never meet.


Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes 
and I don’t believe you
When the summer is gone
It won’t be long 
‘til someone’s got the fever creeping inside
When the city is moving in your eyes 
and you’re a moving and you just can’t fight
That feeling, you said its the last time
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And I don’t believe you
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And I don’t believe you
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes 
and lies are lies
I can’t fight it, no I just can’t fight it
Can’t fight it, no I just can’t fight it now
When the summer is gone
It won’t be long till someone’s
Got the fever creeping inside
When the city is moving in your eyes
and you’re a moving and you just can’t stop
You just can’t fight it, ya 
This is the last time
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And I don’t believe you
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And I don’t believe you
lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
lies are lies
Can’t fight it, no I just can’t fight it
Can’t fight it, no I just can’t
Well we all agree that we don’t believe
This is the last time
This is the last time
Well they promised you
Now you see the truth
This is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
And everyone’s got the fever
(lies are lies, lies are lies, lies are lies)
Lies are lies
(lies are lies, lies are lies)
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And I don’t believe you
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And I don’t believe you
Lies are lies in everybody’s eyes
And lies are lies
Can’t fight it, no I just can’t fight it
Can’t fight it, no I just can’t
Well we all agree that we don’t believe
This is the last time
This is the last time
Well they promised you
Now you see the truth
This is the last time (times five)
When the summer is gone
It won’t be long till someone’s
Got the fever

As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time, instead of at all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hit you at home and they hurt you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow the rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
Till you can't really function,
You're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped with religion, sex and TV
You think you're so clever, and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There's room at the top
I am telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile while you kill
If you want to be like all the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Well, if you want to be a hero then just follow me
If you want to be a hero, well just follow me

Like a cold day in august
I was not prepared for this
You think that nobody noticed
The way that you still care about it...
With all the people we need to love and hate,
Everybody makes the same mistakes
Divided by these walls,
Together we are lost
We are the same blood
all of us. we are. we are
While half of us were lost
The other half forgot
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same
You remind me of august
The way that I still care about
All the things that you promised
When I was still around
Pick you up and drive you down 
We are the same blood
all of us. we are. we are
While half of us were lost
The other half forgot
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same...
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh...
We are the same blood
all of us. we are. we are.
We are the same blood
all of us. we are. we are.
We are the same blood
While half of us were lost
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
The other half forgot
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
Hey hey hey


It was a plane ride from LAX to O'Hare,
and what happened next was a series of unfortunate events.
(Please stay tuned for what happened next...)
The life I breathe for you gives to me new wounds
Well to patch and dress as I reflect on what else I could give you.
Maybe I should blindly throw my faith
into the next thing that comes my way
Standing at the back door with the life that she left behind.
Are we all the same behind the frame
Beneath the glass and fake last names?
I've been waiting far too long to feel the sun on my back.
It was a big bang
and a bright white light from no where.
It turned my coach class window to
A first class seat on the evening news, on NBC.
The life I gave for you is yours
So keep it, you oughtta keep it.
If I had one last chance to take it all back
You know I'd take take take you.
Maybe I should blindly throw my faith
Into the next thing that comes my way.
Standing at the back door with the life that she left behind.
Are we all the same behind the frame
between the glass and fake last names?
I've been waiting far too long to feel the sun on my back.
"Apologies are all we'll ever be," she said.
Standing on the stairs
Looking back, looking hard at me.
"Well, life is long for those who have to wait," I said.
The choice I had to make.
The choice I had to make.
The choice I had to...
(Make)
It was a plane ride. (plane ride)
It was a plane ride. (plane ride)
It was a plane ride.
Just a plane...
Maybe I should blindly throw my faith
Into the next thing that comes my way.
Standing at the back door with the life that I'd left behind.
If we know the way we're gonna die
Through everything else we will survive.
I've been waiting far too long to feel the sun on my back-
Yeah
But one day,
I will stay.


(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
I’ve got that lefty curse
Where everything I do is flipped
And awkwardly reversed
You’re seldom known and barely missed
I always put myself
In destructive situations
I need oxygen
To be exposed where no one goes, where no one’s been
When it all comes crashing...
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we’ve got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight.
Sing it (ow)
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we’ve got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight.
Somebody get my phone
So I can throw it in a public
Pool and watch it float
And as it slowly sinking down,
Become a social ghost
Inside a box, cut at the top
To let some light shine in
To remind me what I’ve done and where I’ve been
When it all comes crashing...
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we’ve got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight.
Sing it (ow)
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we’ve got a big, big, big, big
Mess on our hands, on our hands.
Don’t give in, don’t give up,
I’ll be gone.
You don’t look innocent enough.
We’re too young to be critics
We won’t miss anything at all
Don’t give in, don’t give up
I don’t look innocent with this big, big mess on,
I’ll say something else.
(woah)
(woah)
(woah oh)
We've got a big, big mess
Oh, we've got a big, big mess
Oh, we've got a big, big mess
A big, big mess
Now we've got a big, big mess
A big, big mess
Now kick it!
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we’ve got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight. 
Sing it (ow)
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we’ve got a big, big, big, big
Mess on our hands, on our hands,
Don’t give in, don’t give up (we've got a big, big mess)
I’ll be gone. (a big, big mess)
I don’t look innocent enough
We’re too young to be cynics (we've got a big, big mess on our hands)
We won’t wish any harm at all 
Don’t give in, don’t give up (we've got a big, big mess)
No one looks innocent with this big big mess on our hands tonight. 
(a big, big mess. we've got a big, big mess on our hands)
When it all comes crashing.


I've noticed, people, they all have motives.
Different, yet all the same.
I fumble through every word that was spoken,
and I barely knew your name.
I'm tongue-tied, it runs through my blood and my insides;
Some things we can't escape.
But if we try, if we try, we can leave this behind.
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for.
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?"
Your eyes wide, always ahead of the curve type,
Quiet, and confident.
Oh, we stood there, awkward and youthful, we tangled;
A piece of my soul escaped.
Oh, we are restless and tired of sleeping with giants,
A modern mankind with their egos of fire and it seems like 
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we've waited for.
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?"
Are we wasting time or is it wasting us?
It's been a lifetime waiting for now, now.
Well, you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way before you fold.
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime I've been waiting for.
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?"
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for.
I need an answer, kid, you're either with me or not at all, no, no.
Are we wasting time or is it wasting us?
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, lifetime, yeah.
Well, you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way.
Son you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way,
you've got to find a way before you fold.


You were the only face I'd ever known.
I was the light from the lamp on the floor,
and only as bright as you wanted me to be.
But I am no gentleman, I can be a prick,
and I do regret more than I admit.
You have been followed back to the same place 
I sat with you drink for drink.
Take the pain out of love, and then love won't exist.
Everything we had, everything we had,
everything we had, everything we had 
Is no longer there.
It was the only place I'd ever known.
Turned off the light on my way out the door.
I will be watching wherever you go,
through the eyes of a fly on the wall.
You have been followed back to the same place 
I sat with you drink for drink.
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist.
Everything we had, everything we had,
everything we had, everything we had 
Is no longer there, longer there.
Well, you saw for yourself, the way it played out.
For you, I am blinded.
For you, I am blinded, for you.
I am no gentleman, I can be a prick.
And I do regret more than I admit.
You have been followed back to the same place 
I sat with you drink for drink.
Take the pain out of love, and then love won't exist.
Everything we had, everything we had,
(you have been followed, you have been followed.)
everything we had, everything we had.
(you have been followed, you have been followed.)
Everything we had, everything we had,
(you have been followed, you have been followed.)
everything we had...
I'll be with you wherever you go,
through the eyes of a fly on the wall.


Some people have it and other people don't
You been making some threats. Got my name and address
I'm breaking habits you don't want to know
Although I'm wearing my clothes, feeling cold and exposed, yeah
Don't say you miss me, you probably don't
Well I been crossing some lines, that most folks won't yeah
Don't think you're more than this, or above all this
With your "blah blah blah" and all your friends
Don't say you think you know when you know you don't
Because tonight the bulls are in Brooklyn and you're still at home
Some people have it and other people don't
Though the road that we've paved still goes both ways
I'm breaking habits you don't want to know
Well I been crossing some lines that most folks won't
Don't think you're more than this, or above all this
With your "blah blah blah" and all your friends (all your friends)
Don't say you think you know when you know you don't
Because tonight the bulls are in Brooklyn and you're still at home
Don't think you're more than this, or above all this
With your "blah blah blah" and all your friends (all your friends)
Don't say you think you know when you know you don't
Because tonight the bulls in Brooklyn, said
Don't think you're more than this, or above all this
With your "blah blah blah" and all your friends (all your friends)
Don't say you think you know when you know you don't
Because tonight the bulls are in Brooklyn and you're still at home
Some people have it and other people don't


I took a step back as the room was filling up
And I was packed against these people who were tossing up a strong vibe
Now the door's locked
And the shower's on.
And I realize I don't recognize anyone,
But I don't mind
Well the neighbors have complained damn near every night.
The neighbors have complained damn near every night.
You shoulda shown up
Shoulda shown up by now
You shoulda shown up by now
With a knock at the door,
The knock at the door as it goes
Whoa...
Well now everybody's losing control!
Intoxicated circulation...
Just try and sit back, get my palette wet,
Getting mentally prepared for the consequences
And you know why...
Because that knock at the door
Calls the crowd to quiet.
The neighbors have complained damn near every night.
You shoulda shown up
Shoulda shown up by now
You shoulda shown up by now
Give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a rest
You shoulda shown up
Shoulda shown up by now
You shoulda shown up by now
With a knock at the door
The knock at the door as it goes
Whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa...
There's no one left lying on the second story floorboards
And I'm sure they heard next door
But the bottles are hollow now
And there's room at the bottom
And I would take it all back
If I could, but I won't!
Sit back, get my palette wet,
Getting mentally prepared for the consequences
And you know why...
Because the neighbors have complained damn near every night.
The neighbors have complained damn near every night.
You shoulda shown up
Shoulda shown up by now
You shoulda shown up by now
Give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a rest
You shoulda shown up
Shoulda shown up by now
You shoulda shown up by now
With a knock at the door
The knock at the door as it goes
Whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa...


Subjects are thrown around the room 
Looking for the ones that got away 
A feeling of soft anticipation
Another confrontation I won't make
But how do we do it
We turned into something else entirely
We fake it 
But I wanted it so desperately to be real
Run, run, holding on to some pieces that you left behind 
Hope now, as I walk away, you're the one that finds me out
Run from the only thing left that I hold close
While he's letting you in
You've got the feeling you've been followed under your skin 
It will be weighing on your shoulder, believe it. 
If I could express it in a different dialect or in a delicate way 
I'd capture the phrases inside the cage beneath my chest 
And keep it locked for days 
I wanted you so desperately to believe me 
Run, run, why are you running from another conversation? 
Someone that I've been planning on, you're the one that finds me out. 
There's nowhere, now I found you, that I won't go. 
I'm always letting you in. 
You've got the feeling you've been followed under your skin. 
It will be weighing on your shoulder. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that scene in you. 
Run, run, what are you running from? 
Let all your small steps expose your secrets. 
You don't have to speak for me to believe it. 
But what do you mean? Yeah...ha-ha
Shaken and faint, you've got the feeling you've been followed 
under your skin. It will be weighing on your shoulder. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that scene in... 
While letting you in, you got the feeling you've been followed. 
Are you listening to anything I said? 
Said to anything I said (You've got that seed in you)
Said (You've got that scene in you)
Shaken and faint, it was the hardest thing to swallow. 
Pretending you don't miss me. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that scene in... 
While letting you in, I'll be thinking about tomorrow. 
And every time we cross those lines. 
You've got that seed in you. 
You've got that scene in... 
Hope now, as I walk away, you're the one that finds me out.


Chop chop
I've got myself to blame for this
I've tried to compensate for everything I'm not,
and every face forgotten.
You felt the sun warming your bed
you looked so quintessential pressed against that cross,
in the face of what was lost.
Still I'm not asking much of me,
and you're ignoring the matter...
You'll shut me up and bleed me dry.
Cheap champagne and a complicated lifestyle
If nothing else matters, then
I will die trying,
thinking about you and I.
Three years on Friday since we met
you felt that existential kiss upon your neck.
how could we forget that?
Still I'm through acting like this feels right,
and that nothing else matters.
You'll shut me up and bleed me dry.
Cheap champagne and a complicated lifestyle
If nothing else matters, then
I will die trying,
trying not to think about you...
Yeah
It's on yourself and no one else.
It's on yourself and no one else.
but without hindsight
I guess it serves me right.
You'll shut me up and bleed me dry.
Cheap champagne and a disappearing lifeline.
if nothing else matters
then I will die trying
thinking about you and I.
Shut me up and bleed me dry
it's only a matter of time
Cheap champagne and a complicated lifestyle
it's only a matter of time.
Santi.


If you're under the impression I'm alright.
I guess you never noticed.
I guess you might have known
I've been holding this together for so long.
But I guess you might have noticed.
Well I guess you...
The beast within the burden is all mine
A product of his father, a slave to his pride.
I feel I need to reveal my true stripes,
But the bitch of all this trouble here
Waits behind the wind to find out.
You set me up to leave me,
You wanted to feel,
Shallow love, shallow lives.
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me.
Wanted from me... Yeah
I'm sinking more and more into my lies.
Now home is just a pinprick in the vastness of my life.
Feel the pressure, feel the pleasure,
Feel the pain, you're not alone.
Feel the pleasure, feel the pain,
Feel the pain.
You set me up to leave me,
You wanted to feel,
Shallow love, shallow lives.
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me.
Wanted from me... Yeah
Realizations, I am not what you thought I was.
You change directions everytime someone judges us.
In moderation, what was once us now never was.
You change directions everytime someone judges us.
You set me up to leave me,
You wanted to feel,
Shallow love, shallow lives.
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me.
Wanted from me... Yeah
Realizations, I am not what you thought I was.
In moderation, what was once us now never was.


Don't try and tell me you've been looking at me.
Cause I've been looking at you.
And I can read what you think. Yea.
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me.
Like I don't know how it is,
But I can see it.
You've got no answers but you've got your concerns 
About the people we see
And all the secrets we keep
I think about what you're expecting of me
Like you don't know how it is, 
But I can see all of it.
We always have to wait
By the choice we had to make
You sold yourself so short,
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places...
Don't try and tell me you've been thinking of us,
Cause I will never believe you, now you're shit out of luck, yeah.
Don't cut no corners when you're talking at me.
Like I don't know how it is
But I can see all of it.
So that we always have to wait
By the choice we had to make
You sold yourself so short,
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places...
I see...
We always have been caged
By the choices that we make.
You sold yourself so short.
Is that the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places, I see changes.
In the most unexpected faces, I see changes.
We always have to wait
By the choices that we made.
You sold yourself so short,
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places...
I see changes.
We always have been caged
By the choices that we made.
We sold ourselves so short.
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?


Hey, stop on a dime.
Take both your hands,
reach them above, one at a time.
Are you alone in here?
I heard the voice so clearly.
I tried not to breathe.
Tried not to speak.
Clamping my tongue between my teeth.
Are you alone in here?
I heard the voice so clearly say,
Well, there are fine lines I've seen we are stuck in between.
With separate eyes to use and throw aside.
How we die, nobody wants to know.
Who decides where everybody goes.
Where everybody goes.
Oh, no, this can't be it.
I start to sweat.
Haunted by all the things I've missed.
This can't be right.
I realize right then that it's me or him, yeah.
There are fine lines I've seen we are stuck in between.
With separate eyes to use and throw aside.
How we die, nobody has to know.
Who decides where everybody goes.
Where everybody goes.
(What if I don't?)
Oh, no, I can't believe this.
I don't know why this had to happen.
I had no choice.
Well, it was me or him.
There's a fine line between what is justified or just obscene.
Fragile lines to use and throw aside.
How to die, nobody wants to know.
Who decides where everybody goes.
How we die, no, I will never know.
Who decides where everybody goes.
Who decides where everybody goes.


So the season's changed your face,
toasted skin turned darker shades
so as to better disguise your figure from the streetlights.
First floor window opened up
as you tip-toe on the back porch,
to meet the new girl on the corner,
Make your big plans for the summer.
No one's gonna stay inside,
We're singing,
(dododododo)
We are finally here,
and we're not going nowhere without our friends.
And we can't stop singing,
(dododododo)
Everybody's making sure we stay up till sunset,
but we can't forget.
If we ever find our way back,
this is all we've got.
S-so you borrow your best friend's Jeep,
cracked her windshield and lost her keys.
Crashed the rich kids' parties,
got kicked off of private beaches.
We introduced our friends to yours,
and we would laugh while we were ignored.
And from coast to coast, we'll soon disperse,
but let's live tonight like it's our first.
We've got fast food, tattoos, late talks, longer walks,
checking for the music, for the fireworks and alcohol.
No one's gonna stay inside,
we're singing,
(dododododo)
We are finally here,
and we're not going nowhere without our friends.
And we can't stop singing,
Everybody's making sure we stay up till sunset,
but we can't forget.
If we ever find our way back,
this is all we've got.
I remember sleeping in with the shades drawn,
casting shadows on the bed
Tomorrow feels like it's meant for the fight,
soaring beyond, twisting above.
And when I sleep, I still can feel it,
I can feel it, I can feel.
When I sleep, I still can feel it,
I can feel it, I can feel.
When I sleep, I still can feel it,
I can feel it, I can feel.
No one's gonna stay inside,
we're singing,
(dododododo)
Fuck yeah!
Finally here, and we're not going nowhere without our friends.
And we can't stop singing,
Everybody's making sure we stay up 'till sunset,
but we can't forget.
If we ever find our way back,
if we ever find our way back.
First floor window opened up,
as you tip-toe on the back porch.
(if we ever find our way back)
To meet the new girl on the corner,
make your big plans for the summer.
(if we ever find our way back)
If we ever find our way back,
this is all we've got.


Soft light, total silence
So tired to take the table near the door
The table near the door
Set back under fire
Only as stable as I choose to show
If I choose to show
But where were you that night?
When I was...
Well, I feel that this an explosion
Nobody else could ever really know
I would follow you anywhere
You say you don't believe in science
You're always afraid of what you can't control
I would follow you anywhere
But where were you that night?
When I was...
When I was calling for the answer
That you probably shouldn't know
When it feels like flames surrounding me here
When you were calling with your questions
And all I needed was to know
When it feels like flames surrounding me here
Unkempt and over caffeinated
I walked the forty steps to the room
Back to the room
You say you don't believe in science 
You're always ashamed of what you're willing to lose
I would follow you anywhere
But where were you that night?
When I was...
When I was calling for the answer
That you probably shouldn't know
When it feels like flames surrounding me here
When you were calling with your questions
And all I needed was to know
When it feels like flames surrounding me here
So this is it
So this is it
So this is the silence
So this is the silence we began
It's never quite
It's never quite over
It's never quite over in the silence
When I was calling for the answer
That you probably shouldn't know
When it feels like flames surrounding me here
When you were calling with your questions
And all I needed was to know
When it feels like flames surrounding me here


[Distant:] I'm not in love
One song about a girl
I can't breathe when I'm around her
I'll wait here everyday
In case she'll scratch the surface
She'll never notice
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl
Whoa!
Last night, I knew what to say
But you weren't there to hear it
These lines, so well rehearsed
Tongue tied and over-loaded
You'll never notice
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl
I'm not in love
This is not your song
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl
To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?
To be loved, to be loved
Everyone wants
To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?
To be loved, to be loved
Everyone...
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl
I'm not in love
(To be loved, to be loved, what more could you ask for?)
This is not your song
(To be loved, to be loved, everyone wants)
I'm not gonna waste these words
(To be loved, to be loved)
About a girl.


We're crashing cars we used to share
With summer girls
With summer hair
We're driving around chasing the stars
But the party's busted up
Before it ever starts
I'll never let you go
Don't ever forget
Tell me you'll remember
Forever young
I'll never let you fall
It's not over yet
You and me forever
Forever young
We're forever young
Stop making plans, start making sense
Don't you believe any word they said
Sparked up, sparked up like a book of matches
Falling through the night
And rising from the ashes
I'll never let you go
Don't ever forget
Tell me you'll remember
Forever young
I'll never let you fall
It's not over yet
You and me forever
Forever young
We're forever young
Don't come any closer
Don't tell me it's over
Don't kiss me goodbye
Here we are, am i taking this too hard?
Don't say that it's easy
The hardest part is leaving
Don't you wonder why...
Suddenly, we're all running out of time
I'll never let you go
Don't ever forget
Tell me you'll remember
Forever young
I'll never let you fall
It's not over yet
You and me forever
Forever young
We're forever young
We're forever young
We're forever young


If he knew, what you do
When no one's in the dark room
But me and you
Our brilliant disguise
It's the taste of the chase
I do confess, it's the mess
That feels so right
Call on a Monday
Come on a Tuesday
They'll never know
Pop off a cork for a Wednesday
Play with me Thursday
But you'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday
Come on a Tuesday
They'll never know
Pop off a cork for a Wednesday
Stay with me Thursday
But you'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
Just a kiss, he won't miss
I know you're gonna miss this
As long as you live
When you were mine
Bite your lip, pull me in
It's not the sin, it's the mess
That feels so right
Call on a Monday
Come on a Tuesday
They'll never know
Pop off a cork for a Wednesday
Play with me Thursday
But you'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday
Come on a Tuesday
They'll never know
Pop off a cork for a Wednesday
Stay with me Thursday
But you'll always be his girl

If he knew, what I knew
He'd thank god it's Friday.
He's outta luck, I'm with you.

Look like a lush. Talk like a tease.
The way you like it.
In front of your house, alone on the street,
You ask me to come inside.
Asleep through all our classes,
You hang me out to dry.
If this is a test,
I’m losing my shit
Would it kill you to care
As much as I did?
If this is a test,
I’m wasting my breath
You’re a stranger I know well,
And not at all.
Heart on a hook thrown out to the sea,
Your basement busy.
Sitting in the dark, I turn the radio off for a
Phone call you’ll likely miss.
Wake me when it’s over.
The last sound of goodbye.
If this is a test,
I’m losing my shit
Would it kill you to care
As much as I did?
If this is a test,
I’m wasting my breath
You’re a stranger I know well,
And not at all.
“Let’s imagine the end before we even begin,” you said.
“Let’s imagine the end before we even begin,” you said.
You said,
If this is a test,
I’m losing my shit
Would it kill you to care
As much as I did?
If this is a test,
I’m wasting my breath
You’re a stranger I know well -
If this is a test,
I’m losing my shit
Would it kill you to care
As much as I did?
If this is a test,
I’m wasting my breath
You’re a stranger I know well,
And not at all.
And not at all.
You’re a stranger I know well, and not at all.
And not at all.
You're a stranger I know well.


I walked you home most days
to beat the traffic after class
with all my best intentions.
But when the weather changed,
like fine print, you were hard to read.
Blind-folded, eyes wide open,
staring through me.
I never heard the words that were spoken,
with the rumored nights, with the rendezvous.
I never thought the whispers were true ‘til now…
I saw things that I shouldn’t have tonight, tonight.
I know now what I couldn’t have,
I’ve gone too far to turn it back
I’ve gone too far to turn it back
Followed you home halfway,
over the fence to your backyard,
with all my best intentions.
And through your window frame,
outstretched and lying on your bed,
Blind-folded, eyes wide open,
staring through me.
I never heard the words that were spoken,
with the rumored nights, with the rendezvous.
I never look at you like I used to now
I saw things that I shouldn’t have tonight, tonight.
I know now what I couldn’t have,
I’ve gone too far to turn it back
I’ve gone too far to turn it back
Uninvited, no one knows
how much I care, how bad you are,
How good we’d be, but you won’t let me in
Goodnight I’m leaving.
I never heard the words that were spoken,
with the rumored nights, with the rendezvous.
I never thought the whispers were true ‘til now…
I saw things that I shouldn’t have tonight, tonight.
I know now what I couldn’t have,
I’ve gone too far to turn it back
I saw things that I shouldn’t have tonight, tonight.
I know now what I couldn’t have,
I’ve gone too far to turn it back
I walked you home most days
I had the best intentions
I walked you home most days
I had the best intentions
I walked you home most day


Staring at the mirror through your hair,
You can’t see everything that you did to me.
With your automatic eyes, five years disappeared.
Five years disappeared that night.
Do you want me to stay,
Do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that
I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed,
Time’s up for us
Would you want me to go,
If you knew what I know?
If you knew what I know.
Staring at the wall above the bed, 
I can’t sleep with all the secrets that you keep.
With your automatic eyes,
Five years disappeared.
Five years disappeared that night.


Excuse me, yeah I'm talking to you.
Look in the mirror, could you tell me
what you see?
Hard hearts are crashing in a crowded room.
You never felt so good, you never felt so free.
Save you from yourself
before you start to deal with everyone else.
You should have kept it to yourself,
now we're looking to fight, this isn't alright.
Alright, you better hold your scripted tongue
if you ever plan to use those words again.
The future doesn't make much sense
with you at the helm with your friends.
This is where that ends.
You've got a problem here.
The tide is turning you inside out.
This won't take long your reign is done.
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine.
Spare us your excuse,
cuz this exercise of self-abuse
will swallow everything that you hold dear
the further you are, the closer we get,
the more you need to hold your scripted tongue
If you ever plan to use those words again.
The hallways are filled with silence
and gawking stares that don't care.
This is where that ends.
You've got a problem here.
The tide is turning you inside out.
This won't take long your reign is done.
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time, last time.
This won't take long your reign is done.
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine.
The last time you will shine.
The last time you will shine.
Shine.
This won't take long your reign is done.
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine, shine.
This is the last time
