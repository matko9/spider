in the sticks where you wouldn't go\nIn a town of 1200 off an old dirt road\nAnd a country boy is all I'll ever be\nNow it's been 12 years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.\nHe said \"sign your name here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play\"\nHe set up shop on sunset, he put me up at the marquee\nHe said \"you wanna sell a million records boy you better listen to me\"\nHe said \"change your style, whiten your smile, you could lose a couple of pounds\nAnd if you want to live this life, you better lose that wife, do you need your friends around?\"\nI said, no that's not me\nCause the biggest things in life are your friends and family\nAnd I like my jeans and my old t-shirts\nAnd a couple extra pounds never really hurt\nCause a country boy is all I'll ever be\nCause Hank taught me just how to stay alive\nYou'll never catch me out the house without my 9 or 45\nI got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck\nAnd my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks\nAnd as a country boy you know I can survive\nNow two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel\nOne is the colors that fly high and proud\nThe red, the white, the blue\nThe other ones got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made\n\"Don't tread on me\" is what it says and I'll take that to my grave\nBecause, this is me\nI'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs\nAnd I've said it before but I'll say it again\nCause I've never needed government to hold my hand\nAnd I've said it before but I'll say it again\nCause my family has always fought and died to save this land\nAnd a country boy is all I'll ever be\nI love my country, I love my guns, I love my family\nI love the way it is now, and anybody that tries to change it\nHas to come through me, that should be

heart is\nAnd when I see them in the distance I could cry\nBecause I'm home...\nIn Massachusetts\nWhere my daughters and my wife they wait for me...\nAll alone, but the truth is\nIt's where I always am, it's where I long to be\nNyla started pre-school and Indy just turned two\nAnd Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you\nThey keep getting older, time keeps going by\nTo think about it makes your daddy wanna cry\nSo I just pass the sign that welcomes me to Worthington\nEstablished long before this country came to be\nA place that hasn't really changed with time\nThe way this country that I love, it used to be\nBecause I'm home...\nIn Massachusetts\nWhere my daughters and my wife they wait for me\nAll alone, but the truth is\nIt's where I always am, it's where I long to be\nBecause I'm home...\nIn Massachusetts\nWhere my hero teaches classes everyday\nWhen my friends, they don't treat me different\nIt's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay\nBecause I'm

Let it snow!\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in a storm\nBut if you really, really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd my dear, we're still goodbying\nAs long as you love me so\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in a storm\nBut if you really, really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd my dear, we're still goodbying\nAs long as you love me so\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\nLet it snow! Let it snow!

(doo wah, doo wah)\nI'll always remember...(doo wah, doo wah)\nOo that night\nOo what a night it was, it really was\nSuch a night\nCame the dawn\nAnd my heart and her love and the night were gone\nBut I know I'll never forget her kiss in the moonlight\nOo such a kiss\nOo such a night\nAnd I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender (doo wah, doo wah)\nOh how I remember!
